How to keep track of the number of devices a user uses to complete a conversion? This is something very useful but hidden in every google analytics account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The google analytics feature, cross-device tracking helps identify the user behavior across several devices and the way any specific activity is being done. The report that shows cross device tracking is known as &#8216;cross device reports&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, these reports are invisible in analytics unless you enable cross device tracking. To get this done, you need to make use of a very important feature called \u201cuser-id\u201d, which helps you allocate unique ids to each individual user. To set up cross device tracking via user id in google analytics, follow the steps below and try implement on your analytics account. Here at Marketlytics, we&#8217;ve already done this before. You can check our work by clicking <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/ecommerce\/\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#1 <strong>What is a User-ID?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>A user id in google analytics is a unique set of alphanumeric characters <\/strong><strong>that is assigned to a user to uniquely identify him\/her across multiple devices. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without implementing user-id verification, every interaction of a single user from different devices is recorded as activities by unique users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say, one fine day, a visitor reads your blog post on his phone. He decides to subscribe to your website a week later and purchases a product within a month. All these interactions are counted as activities by three different users. Considering this scenario, after implementing user-id, the same visitor performing the same actions is recorded as a single unique user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/285_image-asset.png\" alt=\" with &amp; without user-id \"> with &amp; without user-id<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A unique user-id represents a unique user in google Analytics. Google analytics tracking code generates a client id for each unique device or browser, which is why you need to create and assign your own unique user-id to send data to GA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All activities associated with the same user id &#8211; be it page navigations, clicks or event occurrences, are sent to Google Analytics in correspondence with the same visitor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>#2 User-ID Benefits<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>User-id makes it possible to implement cross device tracking because it associates sessions across multiple devices to a single user instead of multiple unique users.<\/li><li>By setting up user id you can gain access to cross device reports in google analytics.<\/li><li>With user id you can understand the relationship between multiple devices and engagement between sessions, which is essential while developing new marketing campaigns.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-user-id\"><b>#3 Setting up User-ID in google analytics<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to enable this feature and add your tracking code. By default, cross-device tracking reports are not visible in google analytics accounts. These reports can be accessed by tracking the user with unique sessions across multiple devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Create a User-ID<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to track users across multiple devices, you would need to assign your own user-ids to the user. Follow the steps below to create a user id in google analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step #1:<\/strong> Log in to your analytics account, navigate to the admin section and from under the property column click on <strong>.js tracking info &gt;&gt; User-ID<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/find-user-id.png\" alt=\" find user id \"> find user id<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step #2:<\/strong> Inside the user-id, read the policy and switch the toggle on, to accept the agreement and click next step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/286_image-asset.png\" alt=\" user id policy \"> user id policy<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step #3:<\/strong>&nbsp;Setting up user-id does require a change in analytics tracking code.

Device path<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The device path reports show the order in which a user navigates through your website.

For instance: a user visited your site for the first time using his\/her tablet and purchased a product using the same device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Revenue from other devices<\/strong> displays revenue generated from devices other than the originating device.
