However, with the launch of Universal Analytics, all traffic source related tracking has moved internally to Google&#8217;s servers. While this has made it easier to send data from internal systems back to Google Analytics, it has left a gap for existing integrations that were using GA traffic source information to enrich CRM data earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-13pt; margin-right:-13pt\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">We recently set out to solve this problem for one of our clients. They were relying on having source information in CRM but the migration to Universal broke their integration. This led us to work on a fully featured library that ended up implementing the entire last non-direct click attribution model <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">[1]<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. After battle testing it, trafficSourceTracker code is now available here for everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-13pt; margin-right:-13pt\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The code, once added runs on each page and for every new user landing on the site, stores their traffic source, medium and keyword in a cookie. This source information can then be fetched from any page and passed onto a CRM or form.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-13pt; margin-right:-13pt\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">You can read more detailed installation instructions<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">&nbsp;<\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/marketlytics\/trafficSourceTracker.js\/blob\/master\/README.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. In this post we\u2019ll discuss some cases for putting this data to good use:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:-13pt; margin-right:-13pt\"><strong>1- Enrich CRM Data with Traffic Source<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-13pt; margin-right:-13pt\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This is the most popular use case and the one we directly went after. The main purpose is to provide more context about prospects to sales and marketing teams and allow them to easily see marketing channels in the tool they use the most. Generally, this is usually implemented by passing the traffic information into CRM on form submission as hidden form fields.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:-13pt; margin-right:-13pt\"><strong>2- Enquiry Forms<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/561_image-asset.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-13pt; margin-right:-13pt\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">It is also helpful to know where a user came from with any \u201cContact Us\u201d requests etc. For example, whenever a form is submitted you can pass this info about traffic source along with it <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 563px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2015-10-31-juzud.png\" alt=\"traffic source with form submission\"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">traffic source with form submission<\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-13pt; margin-right:-13pt\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">We hope you benefit from this trick that can definitely help you track traffic sources for all your prospects and make marketing initiatives more data driven.
