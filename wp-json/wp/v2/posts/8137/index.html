Excluding internal traffic is one of the essential steps in <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/how-to-configure-google-analytics\">configuring google analytics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This article will help you exclude single and multiple IPs from your analytics account using multiple methods.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Exclude A single IP Address<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>1. Select the view for which you want to apply filter and then go to filters and click add filter<\/p>\n<p>2. Enter the filter name as \u201cexclude internal traffic\u201d<\/p>\n<p>3. Select the filter type as predefined<\/p>\n<p>4. Enter your IP address as displayed in the image below<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/245_image-asset.png\" alt=\" exclude one ip address \"><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Alternate Option: Exclude Single IP<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There is another way you can use to exclude traffic from your own browser. To do this, install <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/da-vinci-tools\/pekljbkpgnpphbkgjbfgiiclemodfpen?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Da Vinci Tools<\/a> chrome extension. once you install, open your Google Analytics account.<\/p>\n<p>you will then see a switch on the top right of your account along with your tracking ID.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/switch.png\" alt=\" da vinci tools \"><\/p>\n<p>when you turn the toggle off, this extension will block your hits going to GA.<\/p>\n<p>This is a good solution for testing purposes and also for excluding internal traffic. once you add this extension, it will work for all properties in your analytics account. you will not have to add separate filters for each account\/property.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Exclude Multiple IP addresses<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Everything is similar to how we did for a single ip address above except, you have to enter regex for multiple ip addresses. Let\u2019s say we have two exclude two different ip addresses 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.1. The regex would be<\/p>\n<p>^192\\.168\\.0\\.1$|192\\.168\\.1\\.1$<\/p>\n<p>Start with \u2018^\u2019 then precede each dot with a backslash(\\) and put \u2018$\u2019 at the end of ip and separate multiple ips with a pipe(|). The easiest way to write regex for multiple ips is first write down the ips together<\/p>\n<p>1. 192.168.0.1192.168.1.1<\/p>\n<p>2. Add \u2018^\u2019 before the first ip address ( ^192.168.0.1192.168.1.1)<\/p>\n<p>3. Add pipeline between both ip addresses (^192.168.0.1|192.168.1.1)<\/p>\n<p>4. Add backslash just before every dot (^192\\.168\\.0\\.1|192\\.168\\.1\\.1)<\/p>\n<p>5. add \u2018$\u2019 sign at the end of each ip address (^192\\.168\\.0\\.1$|192\\.168\\.1\\.1$)<\/p>\n<p>You can add multiple ips using the above regex.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/246_image-asset.png\" alt=\" exclude two or more ips \"><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to exclude dynamic IP addresses<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One of the most easiest way to exclude traffic from multiple dynamic ip addresses is to install <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/google-analytics-opt-out\/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">google analytics opt-out addon<\/a>.
