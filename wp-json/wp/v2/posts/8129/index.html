For user id, you have to pull the login ids from your authentication system and send to GA as a user id.<\/li>\n<li>Client id is assigned to all website visitors while user id is only applied to login users(you can not track what a non-logged visitor did with user id).<\/li>\n<li>Client id reports are available in every reporting view (Audience &gt;&gt; user explorer) whereas user id reports you need to create new reporting view.<\/li>\n<li>Client id consists of a random number with time stamp separated by a dot. User id only consists of random alphanumeric characters. Time stamp means the time of the first visit.<\/li>\n<li>User id can exist across multiple devices which makes cross-device tracking possible in GA. Client id only exists on the device or browser it has been setup.<\/li>\n<li>The attribution of user engagement is possible with user id because it can exist on multiple devices while with client id create attribution issues.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div class=\"poptin-embedded\" data-id=\"524d62d316aa4\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Understand the difference between client id and user id in google analytics.
