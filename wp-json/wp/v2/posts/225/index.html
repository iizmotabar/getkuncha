Be sure Google Analytics tracks referrals"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Google has been encouraging site owners to move from https to https and dangling search engine ranking boost as a perk. As a result a lot of sites have moved. Most sites have also understandably put in place redirects to ensure users visiting the non secure version get redirected to the new https version of the site. So far so good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">However, one of common issues I have noticed with a slew of recent site audits is how after the switch from https to https a lot of sites see a jump in direct \/ none as traffic source. This is likely because of how https to https redirect has been implemented. As a result sites are losing all referral info about incoming traffic using the <\/span><strong>https-&gt;https<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\"> redirect. Most likely all of this traffic is showing up as <\/span><strong>direct \/ none <\/strong><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">in your account.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 1156px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/383_image-asset.png\" alt=\" spike in direct traffic \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">spike in direct traffic<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">We&#8217;ll dig into how to find out if your https site has this issue and dig into a few ways to fix the problem.&nbsp;<\/span><strong>But if you are currently switching from HTTP to HTTPs you might need to read the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/moving-to-https-changes-required-in-google-analytics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">changes required in google analytics<\/a>. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>      <a href=\"https:\/\/go.marketlytics.com\/case-study-harris-school-solutions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/measure-content-performance-version-3.png\" alt=\" harris school case study \"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Spike In Direct Traffic! <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">HTTP header is the most important thing for google analytics to generate reports about referral data. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Whenever you see a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/causes-of-spikes-in-analytics-reports\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spike in direct traffic<\/a>, this might happen because of the missing referrer data. One of the important reason behind this is moving from secure (https) to non-secure (https).<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 774px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/384_image-asset.png\" alt=\" referral traffic loss \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">referral traffic loss<\/p><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to find if you have an issue<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Visit https:\/\/ version of your site<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">If it redirects to https you <\/span><strong>could<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\"> have an issue, if not, you should redirect the https site to https so everyone is served a single version<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/385_image-asset.png\" alt=\" https to https redirect \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">https to https redirect<\/p><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Visit an https page like so <strong>https:\/\/<\/strong><\/span><strong>yoursecuredomain<span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">.com\/?gclid=123232<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">If redirect is in place it will get redirected to https.&nbsp;Check the final url of your site, does it contain ?gclid=123232 at end of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">If yes, you likely don\u2019t have a problem and can leave the post here \ud83d\ude42 if not, read on..<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">If you don\u2019t see the parameter your site is losing them during the redirect and as a result traffic from Adwords will show up as direct.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">The same would go for any links that have utm parameters being pointed https site, they&#8217;d be lost in redirect and your campaigns will show up as direct \/ none.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">You may ask what about all the awesome sites linking to https version of site? They won&#8217;t show up as source of traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Two ways to do something about it<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>1). Fix all the links<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">This one is a bit tedious, but basically you need to find all links point to https version of the site and make sure to change them to https. This means looking at all ad destination urls in adwords, bing, facebook and making sure they start with https.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Politely asking everyone that links to you to update the link.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">This is of course never 100% doable as you are at the mercy of people that shared your links (and yes, most people are busy) and social media links can&#8217;t be changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>2). Fix your redirect <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">The easier and more worry free way is to make sure that the redirect is setup to pass the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/utm-io-url-shortener-with-google-analytics-utm-tags\">UTM parameter<\/a>. You need to make sure your site passes the HTTP_REFERER header upon redirect and <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">also make sure that url being redirected also includes all the original url parameters <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">being sent to the https page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How do you know it works?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">You should start seeing campaigns and you can also do the test I shared above to verify the &nbsp;issue is fixed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Happy campaign tracking!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Still seeing high direct traffic after fixing the issue let&#8217;s talk and get to the bottom of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Glossary:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">What is an HTTP referrer you may ask?
