We want this to always be the case for everyone as we continue to grow and increase the diversity of the people working here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What we are doing to get there<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hiring &#8211; Applications and Sourcing<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e&nbsp;<strong>Targeted sourcing<\/strong>. We consider applications from everyone, but when we look for candidates, we actively look for people who are under-represented at the moment in our company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2602\ufe0f <strong>Inclusive job adverts thanks to:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Bullet point awareness<\/strong>. We try to keep the core competencies in our job adverts under 6 bullet points since <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/08\/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified\">research shows<\/a> any more than that decreases applications from female candidates.<\/li><li><strong>Encouraging applications<\/strong>. We encourage people who feel they don\u2019t meet all the criteria to apply anyway, to make sure we don\u2019t miss out on someone great because of lack of confidence.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83c\udfe6&nbsp;<strong>No unpaid internships.<\/strong> Unpaid internships are bad practices and exclude young people from low-income backgrounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hiring &#8211; Interviewing<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2753<strong>Structured interview processes with clear assessment criteria<\/strong>. [Research shows](<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/04\/how-to-take-the-bias-out-of-interviews?)\">https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/04\/how-to-take-the-bias-out-of-interviews?)<\/a> that structured interviews help reduce bias when evaluating candidates. Of course, we don\u2019t interview like robots: we ask personalized or follow-up questions too! But we have a core set of questions that we ask everyone, with assessment criteria discussed in advance, so everyone can be evaluated fairly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd14 <strong>We question our conclusions and ask for second opinions<\/strong>. When we are unsure about someone, especially if it\u2019s a screening call where only one person was interviewing, we get second opinions from other people in the team to check our biases. Sometimes we do this for applications as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd13&nbsp;<strong>We\u2019re feedback nerds.<\/strong> We love giving feedback to candidates: we believe it\u2019s important to give something back in exchange for the time invested in getting to know MarketLytics. There\u2019s an extra advantage to this: if the feedback needs to go to the candidate, it means it needs to be well articulated, fair, and justified. A generic \u201cno\u201d isn\u2019t a thing here, and this helps us make sure we\u2019re not biased when we don\u2019t move forward with someone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making sure the team is happy and comfortable<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcb0 <strong>In-house OPD &amp; Medical reimbursements<\/strong> \u2014 We offer reimbursements for the entire family, including parents, so that you know we have your back during difficult times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u270a <strong>We make it work<\/strong> \u2014 Have kids? Live far away? Do you have a non-normative life setup? The thing we care about the most is the team. Once we know we want to work with you, we make it work. Even a reduced work week could be an option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc66 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66 <strong>Parent and family planning friendly<\/strong>. If you\u2019re already a parent, you can set a schedule that plans your work around your family, not the other way round. If you\u2019re soon to be a parent, we will support you to take full maternity and paternity leave. If you need a phased return to work or extra paid time off, we can offer this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcc5&nbsp;<strong>Celebrate what matters to you<\/strong>. Public holiday calendars revolve around specific cultural dates that may not matter to everyone. To help you celebrate what matters the most to you, you can choose to work a public holiday in exchange for another date. Want to swap Eid with Easter or Eid with Diwali?
