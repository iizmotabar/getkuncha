A lot of things are new while others don&#8217;t add up. At back of your mind there is always that sneaking suspicion that something might be wrong.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Below I have mentioned some of the common reasons for inaccurate reports, why it happens and steps you can follow for better accuracy, common checkpoints covered below include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<h3><b>Index<\/b><\/h3>\n<li><a href=\"#title1\" style=\"color:blue\">Your Domain As a Referral\/Self-Referral<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#title2\"  style=\"color:blue\">Low Bounce Rate<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#title3\" style=\"color:blue\">Payment Method As a Traffic Source<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#title4\" style=\"color:blue\">Mismatching Analytics &#038; Actual Sales<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#title5\" style=\"color:blue\">Duplicate Page URLs In Reports<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"title1\">\n  1. Your Domain As a Referral \/ Self Referral<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Self-referral in google analytics is the case when you see your own domain listed in the referral reports. This is a common error which indirectly indicates a problem with your tracking code installation.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 701px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/selfreferralgoogleanalytics.png\" alt=\" self referrals google analytics \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">self referrals google analytics<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">It\u2019s common to have a few visits from self-referrals, but a huge traffic is an indication of inaccurate google analytics reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Causes of Self-Referrals in Google Analytics<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">1.&nbsp;<\/span>Cross Domain Tracking code errors<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 570px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/387_image-asset.png\" alt=\" cross domain tracking \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">cross domain tracking<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Cross Domain Tracking is done when you are using multiple domains. A single mistake while configuring a cross domain tracking can deliver inaccurate reports in google analytics. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">If you made a mistake setting up cross domain tracking, you would see your own domain showing up in referral reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">2.&nbsp;<\/span>Landing page missing analytics tag<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Let\u2019s suppose you have set up a landing page named as page A and is missing <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">the analytics tag. One of the users enters page A via Adwords ad and moves to next page B. Now page B will track the source of traffic as page A instead of the Ad.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 570px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/388_image-asset.png\" alt=\" landing page missing analytics tag \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">landing page missing analytics tag<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix the landing page as a self-referral<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Make sure to properly tag the landing pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Add your domain to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/2795830?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">referral exclusion list<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Cookie Timeout <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">If you have a non-interactive or video\/audio content it might be possible <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">that visitors open your site in the background. By doing this the session will be <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">expired after 30 minutes and when the visitor gets back to the site it will start a <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">new session with a referral of the last page you visited.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 985px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/389_image-asset.png\" alt=\" too many tabs open \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">too many tabs open<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">To avoid this issue increase your cookie\/ session timeout to a maximum of 60-90 minutes. By doing this the visitors who open your site in the background for a long time will count as a single visitor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"#title2\">\n  2. Low Bounce Rate<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Bounce rate is a very annoying metric in google analytics, which always make you fearful, especially when you see a very low bounce rate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">I have seen people frequently questioning about the low bounce rate in analytics communities. A very low bounce rate means a miscalculation which leads to inaccurate reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Causes of low Bounce Rate<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">There are at least three possible reasons for a low bounce rate of your website. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">1.&nbsp;<\/span><strong>Multiple google analytics tracking codes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Whenever a user lands on your site, analytics tag sends a single pageview to <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">google analytics. But what if you have added double analytics tracking code to the same page? Does this still send a single pageview or multiple pageviews? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Yes, I know what you would answer, it will send double pageviews to your analytics account. Let\u2019s look at how a bounce rate is calculated:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Whenever you see a very low bounce rate in google analytics, check your site <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">with google tag assistant to make sure your site doesn\u2019t contain multiple tags. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">2.&nbsp;<\/span><strong>Using iframe on your website<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This is a very common case where users face very low bounce rate due to the <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">iframe. Let\u2019s say you have an iframe on a page, and both contain the analytics tracking code. When a user visited that page a single pageview will be sent to <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">google analytics and after the iframe is loaded it will also send a pageview. This <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">again sends multiple pageviews. Remember that your site should always send a <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">single pageview to google analytics account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">3.&nbsp;<\/span><strong>Auto Event Tracking<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that any implementation of Event Tracking that automatically executes on page load will result in a zero bounce rate for the page.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Event tracking in google analytics is very useful if implemented correctly. But it <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">can be a red flag to bounce rate if configured the wrong way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">If you are firing an event after a pageview is sent to google analytics, it will be considered as an engagement and will indirectly result in a very low bounce rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The best way to avoid this issue is to send the fourth parameter i.e non-interaction. This way the event will not be counted as an engagement.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">ga (\u2018category\u2019, \u2018action\u2019, \u2018label\u2019, \u2018noninteraction\u2019)<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Always avoid sending multiple pageviews to your google analytics account and make sure your website doesn&#8217;t contain multiple analytics tags. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title3\">\n  3. Payment Method as a Traffic Source<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Google analytics by default tracks every incoming traffic to your site and marks it as a referral if it comes from a different website. Every time a new visitor\/referral visits your site, google analytics triggers a new session.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 570px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/390_image-asset.png\" alt=\" third party redirection \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">third party redirection<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><strong>The Problem<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">A common tradition which still makes the google analytics data inaccurate is showing up the payment method as a referrer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">When a visitor begins shopping on your site, a new session is triggered and as he browses different products and adds products to cart, it\u2019s all included in the same session. Once the user proceeds to the payment he is redirected to the third party payment site(i.e Paypal). When he finishes the payment, he is redirected back to your site and at this point google analytics tracks the third party site as the new referral. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This is why you will see the third party site as a referral in your analytics reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Excluding the payment gateway from the referral list<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The best way to resolve this issue is to add the third party site to the <\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/2795830?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">referral exclusion list<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">By doing this, the site will no longer show up in the google analytics referral reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title4\">\n  4. Mismatching Analytics &#038; Actual Orders<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>A common issue which is faced by many online retailers is the discrepancy between actual sales and analytics ecommerce sales.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">It\u2019s quite common to have a 5% discrepancy, but more than 10% mismatching is simply a red flag for handling your ecommerce data. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Common Reasons of Mismatching Sales<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">1.&nbsp;<\/span>Google Analytics is a recording tool, not an accountant<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Google analytics only records the activity that is happening on your ecommerce <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">site. It only keeps record of the customers reaching the order confirmation page. When a customer purchased a product from your site, GA track it as a sale. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">What if a customer returned your product due to a fault? Google analytics does <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">not process historical data and there is no way of excluding this sale from <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">analytics ecommerce reports. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This might be the reason for 5%- 10% discrepancy between your actual sales <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">and sales recorded by google analytics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">2.&nbsp;<\/span><strong>Ask your developer to put correct ecommerce tracking code<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">One of the reasons for data discrepancy is the missing ecommerce tracking code. Your developer might have forgotten to add the tracking code to the order confirmation page, which is why google analytics is not recording any sale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Make sure you have added ecommerce tracking code to all of your pages specially the order confirmation page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Have you enabled enhanced ecommerce?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Enabling enhanced ecommerce(admin&gt;&gt;ecommerce settings&gt;&gt;enhanced <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">ecommerce settings) in google analytics helps in collecting more data from your <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">ecommerce site and more ways of tracking it and thus reducing the data discrepancy.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 415px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/391_image-asset.png\" alt=\" enable enhanced ecommerce \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">enable enhanced ecommerce<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">There are <\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.optimizesmart.com\/google-analytics-shopping-cart-sales-data-dont-match-fix\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">many factors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\"> which lead to inaccurate sales reports and there will always be a little gap between reality and analytics reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title5\">\n  5. Duplicate Page URLs in Reports<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">You will occasionally notice that the same page shows up multiple times in your pages report, making it hard to see total pageviews for the page. This generally happens due to query parameters added to end of urls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/392_image-asset.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Query parameters are the strings attached to the actual URL and they are used for tracking campaigns as UTM parameters. Usually, query parameters come from the site search and are helpful if used correctly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Actual URL: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">https:\/\/marketlytics.com<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">\/services<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">With query parameters:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/services<\/span><strong><em><span style=\"font-size:16px\">?rq=bing<\/span><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to remove query parameters?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">To view the accurate reports in google analytics you would need to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/exclude-url-query-parameters\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">remove query parameters<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. This way you will get the reports of the actual reports without any duplicates. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">There is no doubt that google analytics is a great tool for analyzing your online business.
