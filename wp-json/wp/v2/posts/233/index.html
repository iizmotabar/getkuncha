This previously needed creating a funnel and waiting for it to collect data. Using a hidden report in GA we can now do for any page and that too for historic data!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Read on to see how we can use Google Analytics user flow reports to build funnels for any page.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>First things first: What is a funnel?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">A funnel in google analytics is a path a user takes to complete a specific action. You define this path to see if the visitors on your site follow the steps and at which step most of the visitors drop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">At first, it is difficult to define the specific path but once you have enough data in your analytics, you can do this easily. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Create Any Funnel Using User Flow Reports?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">To help you better understand the process, I will explain the steps using an example. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Let\u2019s say you want to define steps and create a funnel for your contact us page. The funnel would include the previous pages most visitors viewed to reach this page. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Note: <\/em><em>Make sure to select a larger date range to get more data. &nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Follow the steps below to create this funnel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step#1: <\/strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">view the user flow reports by landing pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 283px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/324_image-asset.png\" alt=\" view reports by landing pages \"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">view reports by landing pages<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Step#2: <\/strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">click on the page(\/contact) which you want to track and select \u2018explore traffic through here\u2019. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 338px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/325_image-asset.png\" alt=\" explore traffic through here \"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">explore traffic through here<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The next page will display the specific page along with the previous and next pages. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 932px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/326_image-asset.png\" alt=\" explore specific page \"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">explore specific page<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">From the above report, you can do three important things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Define a page group<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Click on the edit icon and specify the page or the group of pages which you want to track. For example, your blog page may contain different pages. You can group the top pages to view the funnel. &nbsp;To create a funnel for two different pages you have to select a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/importance-of-regular-expressions\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">regular expression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\"> from the match type drop-down. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 389px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/327_image-asset.png\" alt=\" define page group \"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">define page group<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Next, enter the regular expression and click on apply button to view user flow map. <\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"view-previous\"><b>2. View the previous page<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Click on the \u2018+step\u2019 button to view the previous pages viewed by the user to reach this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 725px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/328_image-asset.png\" alt=\" view previous pages \"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">view previous pages<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Once you selected previous steps you can understand the specific path most <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">users take to reach this page. From the above report, you can see, most of the<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">users enter to the contact page from home page, services page and work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">To view a clear path, highlight the previous page by clicking on it and select \u2018highlight traffic through here\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Now you can see clearly which path most users took to reach the contact page. From this report you can define a funnel to be <\/span><strong>home &gt;&gt; about &gt;&gt; services &gt;&gt; contact<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 930px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/329_image-asset.png\" alt=\" highlight traffic \"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">highlight traffic<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The same way you can highlight the other pages to create a different funnel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"view-next\"><b>3. View the next page<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">By clicking on the next step button, you can view the next pages a user viewed after viewing the work page. This can help you understand other pages viewed &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">by the same user and page where they exit.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 712px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/330_image-asset.png\" alt=\" view next pages \"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">view next pages<\/p><\/div>\n<h2><strong>How to use this?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Once you have created the funnel, the next step is to understand how to use these funnels. How you analyze the user behavior and improve the funnel to reduce drop offs. Below are the two important things you can do with user flow funnels. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Find where user Goes after seeing a specific page?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To do this, add the page you want to start the funnel with as step 0.  Use the <a href=\"#view-next\">View Next Page<\/a> option and see what do people do after getting to a page. Do they move on to a desired page? Exit or go somewhere else? You click +Step -&gt; multiple times to continue building the path.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How do people get to a Key page?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Want to find how users get to a desired page (maybe the thank you page)? Add the desired page as step 0 and use the <a href=\"#view-previous\">view previous step<\/a> to see where they started the journey.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">You click <\/span><strong>+ Step &lt;-<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\"> multiple times to continue building the path backward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This is a super useful feature when trying to quickly understand user paths or see which pages are used together by users. You can also double the fun by adding advanced segments based on traffic source \/ user type and improve analysis even further.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Read more about what else <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/list-of-things-google-analytics-can-and-cannot-do\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">google analytics can do<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\"> and let us know your thoughts about this article via <\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MarketLytics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Twitter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how user flow reports in google analytics can be used to create funnel for any page for all the historic data you have collected.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":234,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[3,152],"tags":[22,61,85],"acf":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/233"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=233"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/233\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/234"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=233"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=233"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=233"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
