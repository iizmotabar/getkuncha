What are conversions &amp; how to measure them?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A conversion in Adwords is the number of times your goal is being completed. For example, you are running an AdWords campaign to drive traffic to your website. Your landing page consists of a subscription form and it goes to a thank you page after the form is submitted.<\/p>\n<p>Here, your goal is to drive people to your landing page using the ad, fill out the subscription form and redirect them to the thank you page. So, the number of people coming from your Adwords ads and subscribing to your newsletter are known as Adwords conversions.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways we can measure conversions in Adwords. One is to create a custom conversion and paste the conversion code to our final thank you page. The second way is to directly import Google Analytics goals into Adwords.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, we will talk about creating a custom conversion code and pasting it onto our conversion page.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2). Setup Adwords Conversion Tracking<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Adwords provides a step by step process to set up conversions. If you are new to Adwords and this is your first-time conversion tracking, follow the simple steps below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step1:<\/strong> Log in to your Adwords account<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step2:<\/strong> Click on the settings icon on the top right section of the page, and under <strong>measurement<\/strong> click <strong>conversions<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/open-conversions.png\" alt=\" view conversion in adwords \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step3: <\/strong>If this is your first conversion, click on the \u2018Conversion\u2019 button.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/create-new-conversion.png\" alt=\" create a conversion in adwords \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step4: <\/strong>Select the source of conversion as \u2018Website\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/1_select-source.png\" alt=\" select conversion source as website \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step5: <\/strong>Enter the conversion action details.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Name: Enter a specific name of conversion<\/li>\n<li>Category: select the type of conversion you want to set up i.e Lead, signup, purchase or pageview<\/li>\n<li>Value: Assign a value to your conversion. If you don\u2019t understand you can leave it empty<\/li>\n<li>Count: choose how you wish to count the conversions. Select \u2018one\u2019 for counting only unique conversions and \u2018every\u2019 for counting all conversions.<\/li>\n<li>Conversion windows: select for how long you want to count the visitor as a conversion. For example, if you set the conversion window as 30, a conversion will be counted when a visitor purchases within 30 days of his\/her visit.<\/li>\n<li>Include in Conversions: check to include the conversion action in your \u2018Conversions\u2019 column. You can leave as it is if you don\u2019t understand it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Attribution Model: select how you want to attribute the conversion to the ad. Learn more about attribution modeling <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/6259715?hl=en&amp;authuser=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Click on \u2018Create and Continue\u2019 button.<\/p>\n<p>Step6: To set up conversion tracking, the new setup requires you to add the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/what-is-global-site-tag-and-what-you-need-to-know\">global site tag<\/a> on every page of your website. You will still be able to track conversion without the gTag. However, adding it on every page is now required. Copy the global site tag on all pages of your website if you haven\u2019t already added it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/gtag.png\" alt=\" choose the conversion type \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step7: <\/strong>next, choose when you want to fire the conversion tag. Select page load if you want the conversion to fire each time a page loads, and select event when you want it to fire upon a specific action is completed i.e button click.<\/p>\n<p>Now you will see a code snippet containing conversion ID and label. Both page load and event have different scripts but contain the same id and label. Let\u2019s say I choose the page load type.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"source-code\"><span class=\"cm-comment\">&lt;!-- Event snippet for Free Registration conversion page --&gt;<\/span>\n<span class=\"cm-tag cm-bracket\">&lt;<\/span><span class=\"cm-tag\">script<\/span><span class=\"cm-tag cm-bracket\">&gt;<\/span>\n\n\u00a0<span class=\"cm-variable\">gtag<\/span>(<span class=\"cm-string\">'event'<\/span>, <span class=\"cm-string\">'conversion'<\/span>, {<span class=\"cm-string cm-property\">'send_to'<\/span>: <span class=\"cm-string\">'AW-880330868\/kT7tCNGa73kQ9JDjowM'<\/span>});\n\n<span class=\"cm-tag cm-bracket\">&lt;\/<\/span><span class=\"cm-tag\">script<\/span><span class=\"cm-tag cm-bracket\">&gt;<\/span><\/pre>\n<p>Now, in the script above the line <strong>\u2018send_to&#8217;: &#8216;AW-880330868\/kT7tCNGa73kQ9JDjowM&#8217;<\/strong> is important.<\/p>\n<p>The numeric value <strong>880330868<\/strong> is the conversion id and the alphanumeric value after \u2018\/\u2019 is the conversion label: <strong>kT7tCNGa73kQ9JDjowM<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now you have to create conversion tag in GTM and add the above values in the specific fields.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3). Google Tag Manager Adwords Conversion Tracking<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I suppose that you already have a Google Tag Manager account running and if not, you can type <a href=\"https:\/\/tagmanager.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tagmanager.google.com<\/a> in your browser and follow the instructions to set up an account.<\/p>\n<p>Follow the below steps to add Adwords conversion tracking tag via Google Tag Manager.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> For the sake of this article, let\u2019s assume that you are new to Google Tag Manager, so I can explain every single step in detail, and that is how we can get the maximum number of people to benefit from it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step1:<\/strong> log in to your tag manager account<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step2:<\/strong> create a new tag by clicking on the \u2018New Tag\u2019 tab.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/24_image-asset.png\" alt=\" create a new tag \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step3:<\/strong> Enter the name of the tag as \u2018Adwords Lead Conversion Tag\u2019. Here, Lead is the conversion category I selected in the previous step. You can change this according to your conversion type so this can be uniquely identified among many other tags.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step4:<\/strong> Click on Tag Configuration and select the tag type as \u2018Adwords Conversion Tracking\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/25_image-asset.png\" alt=\" create adwords conversion tag \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step5:<\/strong> Go back to Adwords and copy the conversion ID and conversion Label I highlighted in the previous step. Paste those values in the appropriate fields in Adwords tag configuration.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/conversion-tag.png\" alt=\" configure conversion tag \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note: you can also send a dynamic <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/adwords-dynamic-conversion-values-google-tag-manager\">conversion value through GTM<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step6: <\/strong>Click on the advanced settings and select the tag firing option as once per page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/26_image-asset.png\" alt=\" choose tag firing options \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step7: <\/strong>Click on the \u2018Triggering\u2019 tab and create a new trigger to fire this tag on specific pages. Enter a unique name for the trigger. Select the trigger type as \u2018Page View\u2019, and choose the trigger to fire on some pages.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to understand this step here. We have to set the condition so that it will only fire the conversion code to the thank-you page only, not on all pages.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if the URL of your thank you page is:<\/p>\n<p>https\/\/example.com\/<strong>thank-you<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The highlighted part above is known as the page path and it is saved in the Page Path variable in Google Tag Manager.<\/p>\n<p>The image below will clearly help you understand the trigger condition.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/27_image-asset.png\" alt=\" set up conversion trigger \" \/><\/p>\n<p>All the triggers would be the same except the page path. Look at your thank you page URL and paste the page path the in a specific field and save the trigger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step8:<\/strong> Save the tag.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/28_image-asset.png\" alt=\" save conversion tag \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step9: <\/strong>test and debug this tag before setting it live on the page. Click on the preview button on the main page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/29_image-asset.png\" alt=\" preview changes tag manager \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step10: <\/strong>Open your thank you page in a new page to verify if the tag is firing correctly. If you have followed the steps carefully, you will see the Adwords tag firing in the preview tab.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/30_image-asset.png\" alt=\" adwords conversion tag testing \" \/><\/p>\n<p>If the Adwords tag isn\u2019t firing, you might have missed a step. Go to step one and revise if you have followed all the steps properly.<\/p>\n<p>Step11: Go back to your tag manager account, click on leave preview mode link, and click on the submit button to publish the changes.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4). Add Conversion Linker Tag<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Now, with the new update, you have to add the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/tagmanager\/answer\/7549390?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conversion linker tag<\/a> also. To do this, create a new tag, select the tag type as conversion tag and set all pages trigger.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/conversion-linker.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finally, publish changes in your container.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5). Verify Adwords Conversion Tracking<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To verify the conversion tag you have added on the page is correct or not, we can test it with Google Tag Assistant. To do this:<\/p>\n<p>Install Google Tag Assistant in your browser if it\u2019s not installed.<\/p>\n<p>Open you thank you page in a new tab.<\/p>\n<p>Click on the tag assistant icon, enable it, and reload your page.<\/p>\n<p>You will see the list of tags being fired on your page and it will include the conversion tag.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/31_image-asset.png\" alt=\" google tag assistant check conversion tag \" \/><\/p>\n<p>If in case, a problem occurs with your tag, tag assistant will display the error type.<\/p>\n<p>If everything is successful up to this point, go to your Adwords account and hit the \u2018Done\u2019 button to save your conversion tag.\u00a0You can set up the Facebook conversion tracking similarly.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6). View conversion in Adwords<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>After everything being set up, you are probably excited to view the number of conversions resulted in your Adwords ad. To view the number of conversions for the click on tools and select conversions from the top navigation bar.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/32_image-asset.png\" alt=\" view conversions in adwords \" \/><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Bonus tip: Adding the conversion code on a landing page or thank you page?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We can add the conversion tag to our website in two ways. First, is either set a trigger that will fire on a specific action on the landing page and the second is by setting a trigger that will fire upon thank you page load.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are recording leads, you can fire the conversion trigger when a form is submitted. If it takes to a thank you page after submission, you can add the conversion tag to the thank you page.<\/p>\n<p>otherwise, if it just reloads or simply pop-ups a thank you message, you will have to add the conversion when the submit button is clicked. But, here you will have to be careful about form validation. The conversion tag should fire after validating the form inputs.<\/p>\n<p>you will have to write a script that will validate the form submission during run-time. To get this done easily, follow our <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/form-submission-tracking-google-tag-manager\">form submission tracking<\/a> guide.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I hope you found this tutorial helpful and by now, successfully integrated Adwords conversion code on your website using Google Tag Manager.
