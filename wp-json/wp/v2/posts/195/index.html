Or was all your content marketing strategy for naught?<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Short of sitting with every user as they give your post a read. We use a few proxies for estimating engagement. One of the easiest to use and understand is scroll tracking. This is where we consider people scrolling down a page to estimate engagement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Why to use scroll tracking&nbsp;to measure content engagement?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Broadly scroll tracking gives us a trove of data to answer a few questions every (serious) content writer and marketer has wondered about.<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Understand where people drop-off?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Why do they drop-off?&nbsp;Is it because content is too long?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">See where to place key call to actions?
