Especially when it comes to website traffic, google analytics is the best tool to use. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The way you measure content marketing KPIs may be limited to few metrics and dimensions. This article aims to explain how google analytics can be used to accurately measure content marketing KPIs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>First things First: Use User Level Advanced Segments<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Using advanced segments in google analytics has more benefits, out of which filtering reports on user level are significant. By default, it is set to session level metric which displays the total number of sessions.<\/p>\n<p>By filtering reports on the user level, you can track all those users whom you acquired once via any source and later they become your long term customers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1). User Engagement<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The first content marketing KPI you would measure is user engagement which includes, the total number of visitors, bounce rate, Avg. time on page and &nbsp;new vs returning visitors. You can easily view these reports in google analytics. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">You can create segments to view reports about specific campaign or channel and how it is performing. Let\u2019s measure all those users who have visited your site via Facebook and later on they came back to your site and become your customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">First, create a segment, click on the <\/span><strong>add segment<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\"> button or navigate to specific view and select segment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">1st step: &nbsp;Add Segment<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 264px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/375_image-asset.png\" alt=\" create segment \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">create segment<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">2nd step: Select new segment and go to advanced segments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Create a conditional segment and apply filter on user level. By default the filter is set up on session level. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 783px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/376_image-asset.png\" alt=\" apply user level filter \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">apply user level filter<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">3rd step: select ad content as source from the dropdown and enter facebook.om in the text field.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 805px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/377_image-asset.png\" alt=\" select ad content advanced segments \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">select ad content advanced segments<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Now, this segment will show you all those visitors who have visited your site via Facebook. By customizing this segment, you can view bounce rate and Avg. time on page for specific channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">In the last content marketing KPI, you will learn how to measure all these users who later on became your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2). Inbound Links<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The google analytics referral report displays the list of sites that are linking to your site. Tracking referral reports will help you understand the importance of backlinks, the number of visitors other websites are transferring to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 834px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/378_image-asset.png\" alt=\" google analytics referral reports \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">google analytics referral reports<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Google analytics referral reports sometimes get infectious by spam and self-referrals. You must be aware of this issue and exclude anything that is unrelated and generates faulty reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to exclude Spam Referrals?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">To exclude spam referrals from your google analytics referral reports, use the <\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.simoahava.com\/analytics\/spam-filter-insertion-tool\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">spam filter insertion tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\"> by Simo Ahava. This automatically excludes the future bots from your referral reports. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to Exclude Self-Referrals?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Self-referrals in google analytics show your own domain as a referral, which does not make any sense. To avoid this behavior in google analytics you have to include your own domain to the <\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/2795830?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">referral exclusion list<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3). The User Journey: Behavior Flow<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The third content marketing KPI would be the behavior flow reports in google analytics. This report displays where a user is hanging out on your site, from the page he enters to the exit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/behavior-flow-reports-google-analytics\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Behavior flow in google analytics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\"> can better display the results of your marketing strategy and show how users interact with your site. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 625px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/379_image-asset.png\" alt=\" behavior flow reports \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">behavior flow reports<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Why is behavior flow important?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It displays the most engaging content on your site<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Identifies your site problem areas and potential content issues.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4). Scroll Tracking<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/scrolldepth.parsnip.io\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Implementing scroll tracking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\"> in google analytics should be a must install for every content marketer. It helps you measure how far a user scrolls your content and as a result how much they engage with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 833px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/scrolldepth.png\" alt=\" scroll tracking reports \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">scroll tracking reports<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Each time user scrolls the page, an event is recorded in google analytics. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">There are a lot of interesting questions you can answer with scroll data, some of these are covered here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5). Your Audience Location: Geography<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The google analytics geography report displays the location of your audience. You can change the primary dimension to view reports by city, region, continent and subcontinent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Using google analytics, you can create a separate segment to analyze the behavior of visitors in different regions. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 1009px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/380_image-asset.png\" alt=\" google analytics demographic reports \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">google analytics demographic reports<\/p><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6). Device Category<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Optimizing your site for the mobile device is a must to index in google search results. The mobile overview reports in google analytics show the number of people visiting via the mobile device. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">You can also view which mobile devices your users are using while browsing your content. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The information displayed in google analytics geography and device category can help you understand your <\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/30907\/9-Questions-You-Need-to-Ask-When-Developing-Buyer-Personas.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">buyer persona<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>7). Conversions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">At the end of the day, all your content marketing efforts are concluded by the number of conversions you have. In google analytics, you can set up goals to record the number of conversions. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 1003px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/381_image-asset.png\" alt=\" google analytics goal conversions \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">google analytics goal conversions<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Let\u2019s take an example to understand how google analytics goal conversions can determine your content marketing strategy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This will check the number of people visiting your site via Facebook, who are being converted into your customers. To do this, you have to create an advanced segment, but this time we use sequential segments.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 796px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/382_image-asset.png\" alt=\" google analytics sequential segments \"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">google analytics sequential segments<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Look carefully at the above image, I have applied filter on user level so that I can get the number of users instead of sessions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">So far I have concluded a few significant content marketing KPIs that can be better tracked in google analytics.
