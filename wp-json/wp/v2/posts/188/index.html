This ensures that the data our analytics tools collect matches the actual number of submissions recorded in your system.<\/p>\n<p>Google Tag Manager provides built-in functionality to track validated form submissions but there are some limitations to the approach. I discuss two ways to implement validation to improve conversion tracking below.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>FORM VALIDATION WITHIN A WEBSITE<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Building form validation within a website is a good practice as it ensures that the user fills out correct information. This saves time spent on waiting for an https response and also saves server from dealing with bad form input. This is a common feature of most form plugins as seen in the image below.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/img_5e62374d07473.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Even with validation embedded in website code, GTM by default, fires the form submission tracking tag whenever the form is submitted, regardless of incomplete form inputs and at times, empty forms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>FORM SUBMISSION TRACKING GOOGLE TAG MANAGER<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To ensure that a form is validated, Google has created form validation within the website, which ensures that Form Tag is only fired when form gets submitted successfully.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/dddd.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Does \u201cCheck Validation\u201d Validate All Forms?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We can see <strong>Check Validation <\/strong>box under Configure Trigger but this validation is limited to validating certain elements, like where the form is located on the site, and not the actual field validation that is required to actually validate form.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A RELIABLE ALTERNATE<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/google-tag-manager-events-complete-guide#form-submission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tracking form submission with GTM<\/a>\u00a0is quite different and it tracks whenever the form is submitted. Best practice of validating forms is to utilize custom Javascript code and apply it as required, triggering condition. To do so, we create a Custom Javascript Variable within Tag Manager.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please note this requires familiarity with javascript. If that is not what you are used to, share the following with your developer:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Under<strong>\u00a0Container Tab <\/strong>in GTM, select <strong>Variable<\/strong>\u00a0from left navigation.<br \/>\nScroll-down to <strong>User-Defined Variables.<\/strong><br \/>\nClick <strong>New button<\/strong>.<br \/>\nSelect <strong>Custom JavaScript <\/strong>as the required type.<\/p>\n<p>Here we can write any kind of validations required before successful submission.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Example: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/540_image-asset.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">In the case of the aforementioned example, I have a simple user feedback form. There are three fields with id input1, input2 and input 3 respectively. The following code can be used for simple validation:<\/span><\/p>\n<pre class=\"source-code\">function(){\n        var emailReg = \/^([a-zA-Z0-9_.+-])+\\@(([a-zA-Z0-9-])+\\.)+([a-zA-Z0-9]{2,4})+$\/;\n        var ContactForm = jQuery('#gform_3');   \n\n     if(ContactForm.find('#input1').val().length&gt;0\n        <span class=\"cm-error\">&amp;<\/span><span class=\"cm-error\">&amp;<\/span> emailReg.test((ContactForm.find('#input2').val()))\n        <span class=\"cm-error\">&amp;<\/span><span class=\"cm-error\">&amp;<\/span> ContactForm.find('#input3').val().length&gt;0)\n    {\n        return true;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n}<\/pre>\n<p>The code makes sure that there are no empty fields when form is submitted.<br \/>\nIt also validates that email input is in correct format.<\/p>\n<p>You can extend code by further validating data type of \u201cName\u201d field or put checks for any other validation, depending on what you require.\u00a0<strong>Make Sure to Match GTM Validation with Site Validation.<\/strong>\u00a0Once this variable is created, we can integrate it in our Form tag.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/img_5e62374e988b0.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">As shown above, under the <\/span><strong>Fire On<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0section, we have included additional condition <\/span><strong>contactFormValidation<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">(Custom Javascript Variable) to be true to trigger Form Submission. Once Tag is updated and published, we don\u2019t have to worry about Form Validation anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">If you have multiple forms you\u2019ll need to create a validation variable for each one based on fields in the form. Once this trigger is ready you can apply this to any tag that is triggered based on form submission tracking and it will ensure that the data becomes accurate by only firing on valid conversions.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"poptin-embedded\" data-id=\"524d62d316aa4\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An improved version of form submission tracking in Google Tag Manager.
