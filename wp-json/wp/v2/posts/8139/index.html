If the Pixel code is inserted correctly on your website, the Facebook Pixel Helper will automatically detect the code and will display information about your pixel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/106_image-asset.png\" alt=\" facebook pixel helper \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your pixel helper is displaying information like above, then your Facebook Pixel is working perfectly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you see any error or want to know more about debugging pixel helper problems keep reading this guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/contact-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"384\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Facebook-Pixel-Expert-1024x384.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10792\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Facebook-Pixel-Expert-1024x384.png 1024w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Facebook-Pixel-Expert-300x113.png 300w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Facebook-Pixel-Expert-768x288.png 768w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Facebook-Pixel-Expert-1536x576.png 1536w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Facebook-Pixel-Expert-2048x768.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Facebook Pixel Common Errors<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There might be multiple types of errors according to your pixel setup. But below are the most common type of errors and ways to resolve them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Duplicate Pixels Found <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The very important thing you need to keep in mind is that if you can have multiple pixels on your website but not multiple similar pixels. Which means if you add the same pixel code multiple times on your site, it will result in duplicate pixels error.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are installing <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/add-facebook-pixel-in-google-tag-manager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook Pixel with Google Tag Manager<\/a>, you don\u2019t need to add the pixel code on your website. GTM will automatically fire the pixel code on your site. <strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution: <\/strong>If you are seeing a duplicate pixel error, dig in your website code and make sure you don\u2019t have added the single pixel code on multiple places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pixel did not load<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This errors shows up when pixel helper detects the pixel code on your website, but the HTTP call was never made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are commonly two reasons for this error.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Error in your pixel code<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution: <\/strong>Check your pixel code to make sure you didn\u2019t made a mistake while copying and pasting the code. Compare the code on your site with that on provided on your Facebook account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Pixel fires on dynamic event<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution: <\/strong>in this case the error will automatically disappear upon clicking on the button. <strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Not a Standard Event<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of error occurs when the event found by pixel helper is not one of the standard events. For example, the event is named AddCart instead of AddToCart. It is recommended to use standard events as much as possible. But if you named that event for a reason you can ignore the error. <strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Multiple Times Pixel Activation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This error occurs when the pixel with the same ID and event is sent multiple times to Facebook. This should only occurs once upon page loading and is an error. <strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution: <\/strong>If you are seeing this error make sure to send the pixel id and event once and upon page loading. If it is sent with different data custom data parameters, those parameters should be merged into single pixel event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Invalid Pixel ID <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This error occurs when the pixel ID you send to Facebook doesn\u2019t match with any ID on their system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution: <\/strong>Check your Facebook ads manager and confirm the pixel ID is not different<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Troubleshooting Suggestions<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pixel helper is not just build to confirm installation and report errors but it can also suggest that something could be changed to improve performance. <strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pixel took too long to load<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This error shows up when you place the pixel code somewhere between the body or footer tags. The recommended way is to place the pixel code before the closing &lt;\/head&gt; tag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"poptin-embedded\" data-id=\"82948c996a175\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to install Facebook pixel helper on your browser and fix errors and issues to make sure your pixel is working correctly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[56],"acf":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8139"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8139"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8139\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8139"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8139"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8139"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
