Perfect! Now we can talk about when to set up each conversion and how.<\/p>\n<p>Follow me!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Website <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To set up a conversion on your website, select \u2018website\u2019 as the conversion type. . Your website conversion can be a form submission, a purchase, a sign-up or even a page view. Basically anything within this circle that suits, your fancy.<\/p>\n<p>For the purpose of explaining how this is done, let\u2019s head on towards a quick example.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re creating a conversion for a form submission on your website, assuming that there is a unique thank you page after the form submission.<\/p>\n<p>Follow the steps below:<\/p>\n<p>After selecting the conversion type as \u2018website\u2019, a conversion action needs to be created.<\/p>\n<p>\u2019 Set the name of your conversion to be Contact Us\/Sign up\u2019 depending on the type of form you are using<\/p>\n<p>Select the category as \u2018Lead\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Add a value for your conversion i.e how much a single conversion is worth for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your conversion type assign a value for your conversion<\/p>\n<p>Select the count as \u2018every\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Conversion window equals \u201830 days\u2019<\/p>\n<p>View-through conversion window equals \u20181 day\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Include in conversions equal \u2018yes\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Attribution model equals last-click<\/p>\n<p>Look at the image below for an overview<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/8_image4.png\" alt=\" form submission conversion \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now if you\u2019re satisfied with how this has turned out, hit the \u00a0\u2018CREATE AND CONTINUE\u2019 button.<\/p>\n<p>On we go!<\/p>\n<p>Next,\u00a0you will see options for how you want to set up the conversion code. For the sake of this article, I am choosing the \u2018install the tag yourself\u2019 option. However, if you\u2019re more comfortable with the idea of adding the code using Google Tag Manager, that can definitely be done too, in that case, feel free to hop on over to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/google-tag-manager-adwords-conversion-tracking\">this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/6_image5.png\" alt=\" tag setup \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now according to the most recent changes in Adwords, you now need to add the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/what-is-global-site-tag-and-what-you-need-to-know\">global site tag<\/a> to your website before your add the conversion code.<\/p>\n<p>Now what is Global Site Tag?<\/p>\n<p>For a short and sweet answer: Global Site Tag is the latest version of the analytics tracking code after universal analytics.<\/p>\n<p>If you already have gTag added to your site, you may proceed directly to adding the conversion code. If the case is otherwise, however, you will need to replace the old universal analytics, with the gTag code, and then add the conversion code right after.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/5_image8.png\" alt=\" conversion code \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, the next step will depend on your site\u2019s possession of a specific thank you page.<\/p>\n<p>If you do have a separate, dedicated thank you page, go ahead and select the code to fire on page load.<\/p>\n<p>In case you don\u2019t have one, you can still fire the code on a submit button-click.<\/p>\n<p>Now, hit \u2018next\u2019 to finish the set up.<\/p>\n<p>The next step is to verify if the conversion code is working and the conversions are being recorded in Adwords. To do this you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/tagassistant\/answer\/2947095?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6000196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Tag Assistant<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. App<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This one tracks conversions on mobile apps. Now, this could be an app installation or a purchase within your app. If you wish to create an app conversion, go ahead and select \u2018app\u2019 as the conversion type.<\/p>\n<p>Now would be the time to select how you want to track your app conversions i.e firebase, google play, third-party etc, do go through the conversion action steps according to the conversion type you selected.<\/p>\n<p>A conversion code isn\u2019t an absolute necessity when it comes to app type conversions. You can pretty much get away with simply connecting your Adwords account with the app store, firebase, or any third party store according to the conversion type you selected.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Phone Calls<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Phone calls are very important to your business, especially when you display a phone number on your website or on the ad. If the purpose of your ad or landing page is to generate phone calls, it is important to also track them.<\/p>\n<p>Google Adwords provides a simple way to track phone calls. All you need to do is set up a phone call conversion. There are three ways to track phone calls in Adwords. Create a new conversion and select the conversion type as phone calls to view these options.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/5_image7.png\" alt=\" phone calls conversion tracking \" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Calls from ads using call extension or call-only ads<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you are placing a phone number on any of your ads, you can select this option to measure conversions. To do this, check the first option in the image above and click continue..<\/p>\n<p>Now, enter the conversion name<\/p>\n<p>Select the category as \u2018Lead\u2019<\/p>\n<p>If you want to track the revenue, assign a value to the conversion otherwise, select \u2018do not use value\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Select the call length. Not every call leads to a conversion but you can select any time frame less than 60 seconds to be a conversion. For example, if you select the call length as 45 seconds, any call greater than 45 seconds will be considered a conversion.<\/p>\n<p>Select conversion window as 30 days<\/p>\n<p>Include in conversions equals \u2018yes\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Attribution model equals last click<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/16_image3.png\" alt=\" phone calls from ad \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you have done this, click \u201ccreate and continue\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Now this type of conversion doesn\u2019t need a tracking code added to your website. It will automatically record a conversion when a phone call number is clicked on your ad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Calls to a phone number on your website<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This type of conversion is used when you place a phone number on your website. It records a conversion when the phone number on your website is clicked.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/18_image2.png\" alt=\" conversion tracking for website \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you fill up the conversion details, click \u2018create and continue\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>With the new Adwords updates, there are two codes you need to add to \u00a0your website in order to track this conversion. First is the Global Site Tag and second is the conversion code.<\/p>\n<p>In the second step, choose from the options for Global Site Tag and update it according to your current implementation.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/4_image9.png\" alt=\" global site tag \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you are done, click next\u2019 to complete the conversion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Clicks on the number on your mobile website<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This records a conversion when someone clicks on a phone number link on your mobile website.<\/p>\n<p>To create this one, follow the same steps as the previous conversion.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to install the Global Site Tag first and then add the conversion code in order to track them correctly.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Import<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The final way to setup Adwords conversion tracking is by importing from data sources like Google Analytics, Firebase, Salesforce, third-party apps, or CRMs.<\/p>\n<p>If you have already set up goals in Google Analytics or any other tool you prefer to work with, you don\u2019t need to create conversions in Adwords. You can simply import those conversions to Adwords.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best practices \u00a0is to import Google Analytics goals in Adwords. To do this, you will have to connect Adwords with Google Analytics. Then using the import method you can import any goal you have created in Analytics.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about importing Google Analytics goals, click <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1034306?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Over to you!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If i\u2019ve done my job well, you now know a thing or two about Adwords conversion tracking, than you did before.
