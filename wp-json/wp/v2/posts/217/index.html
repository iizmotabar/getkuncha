You would need to familiarize yourself with google analytics which will be your favorite companion. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Determine the Source of your Audience<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">For running a successful marketing campaign you have to discover the source of your traffic. How would you know which campaign is driving more traffic? Which marketing campaigns are driving the most successful leads? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Let\u2019s move on to further understand in detail how you can actually capture the source of your campaigns in analytics account. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Using UTM Parameters<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">UTM(Urchin Tracking Module) is a simple code\/parameters you can add to the end of your custom URL in order to track the source of traffic. It is also known as UTM parameters which send data to your analytics account. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">You can track five things using UTM parameters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Campaign<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It is the unique campaign name or promo code for a single campaign<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">utm_campaign=\u201dwintersale20percent\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Source<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The site that is responsible for sending you the traffic. It can be facebook, twitter, google+ or any other site. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">utm_source=\u201dtwitter\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Medium<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The type of medium used for your campaign. For example social media, email or ads<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">utm_medium=\u201demail\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Content<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This parameter is used to differentiate between links and content within the same ad. If you have two identical links on the same page you can use utm_content to differentiate between them. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">utm_source=\u201dfooterlink\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Term<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This parameter is specifically used for paid keyword terms. If you are paying for <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">keywords using PPC, this must be used.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">utm_term=\u201demail+marketing\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">For tracking any URL you must use the first three parameters(campaign, source, medium) to get the necessary data in analytics.
