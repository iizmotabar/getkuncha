Track any clicks that happen on your site<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The greatness of Google Analytics lies in its capability of tracking events, clicks and page scrolls on your site. You can track clicks on your site whether it is an ad click, outbound link or any other site navigation link.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/using-inpage-analytics-chrome-extension\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Using Inpage analytics reports<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> are very helpful when it comes to tracking clicks on your site.

You can segment your data for new visitors, referral traffic, organic traffic or you can do more with <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">conditional and sequential segments<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/461_image-asset.png\" alt=\" create new segments \"> create new segments<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What you can\u2019t do with Google Analytics?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.&nbsp;It cannot track individual user: prohibited by google<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Google Analytics strictly prohibits sending Personally Identifiable Information(PII) instead it allows sending a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/3123662?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">unique user id<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">. You are not permitted to store any personal information of any individual user like username or IP address in any custom variable but you can store a unique id for that individual user. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Learn more about what <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/analytics\/terms\/us.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">section 7 of the google analytics terms of service<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\"> says about tracking individual users. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. <\/strong><strong>Process historical data&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Google Analytics will only process data from the time you started tracking your site. It won\u2019t be able to process any historical data that your site has before connected to GA. For example; you have set up your analytics tracking on august 2016, it will only process data from the date onwards and no data will appear before the starting date. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">You can use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/3191589?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">data import<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> feature in GA to combine data collected from other sources and then combine and analyze all of the data according to your business needs.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Tell you what the user did on Facebook or other social networks<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">As mentioned earlier you can track events, clicks, form submissions and how a user navigates on your site. How about what a user does on your Facebook page or any other social sites? <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. If the user visited your competitor&#8217;s website<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Once a user lands on your site Google Analytics starts tracking his behavior, what pages he visits, which content he is viewing and what other things he performs on your site. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">After a user is abandoned from your site GA will not be able to track where he goes. In short, google analytics can\u2019t track where a user is hanging out on the internet. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">If you are tracking an ecommerce site you can use the funnel visualization reports to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.lemonstand.com\/cart-abandonment-google-analytics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">track shopping cart abandonment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> in GA. On the other hand, if you are tracking a form on your site, you can check which fields are being filled and which are not by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lunametrics.com\/blog\/2012\/11\/13\/track-form-abandonment-google-analytics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">tracking form abandonment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> in analytics.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. When a user deletes his browser cookies<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Google Analytics uses cookies to keep track of new vs returning visitors and once a user deletes his cookies, the next time he visits your site he will be considered as a new user. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">In other words, if a user disables javascript in his browser and continues browsing your site he will not be tracked in GA. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">If enough people find this helpful; I&#8217;ll go ahead and a bit more color to this with links to how this stuff can be done. What have you found surprising that GA was capable of or lacked?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"poptin-embedded\" data-id=\"82948c996a175\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A compiled list of things that google analytics can do and cannot do in order to remove your confusions about google analytics features.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":214,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[61],"acf":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/213"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=213"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/213\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/214"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=213"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=213"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=213"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
