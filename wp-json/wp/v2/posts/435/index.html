So now you wonder what you missed.<\/p>\n<p>Or you\u2019ve been struggling hard to promote your products and increase traffic to your blog and you\u2019ve tried every trick in the book before finally realizing that you just don\u2019t make the cut for all the \u2018technical\u201d jazz you\u2019ve been reading since last week.<\/p>\n<p>The struggle is real. I can swear on sky blue pancakes that we\u2019ve all been there, at some point in our internet driven careers.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t despair. We\u2019ve scratched out the jargon, and selected the top seven, best, insanely uncomplicated ways to increase traffic to your site in the current millennium. In the following, is your pot of gold.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Add share triggers to your content &#8211; Content meets World! <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a secret. Social media is a gold mine and where there is no magic potion that is going to bring you a sky-high spike in your traffic, social media, is what comes remarkably close. Here\u2019s how to use it wisely.<\/p>\n<p>First things first, before we get all excited, whatever your content is, we need to make sure that it is \u201cshareable\u201d. People like sharing positive, useful and practical things. Emotional content also has a very high likelihood to be shared.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/8_image6.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve done that, you need to add those share triggers and let the world be your audience. Just kidding, not really. What this will do, is get you the kind of traffic that you really really need. The kind that will have the highest conversion probability. You see people tend to have social circles that more times than not, involve like-minded people. And if someone likes your post enough to share, you can be sure that there are people on his social media who will also be interested in what you have to offer, and if what you offer is good enough, they will stick with you.<\/p>\n<p>In much the same way, you can also directly share your content on your preferred social media platforms, however, that will need to be strategically timed to produce the maximum effect. The infographic on the left shows the best times to post on certain social platforms.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Use email marketing &#8211; the right way<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/1_image2.jpg\" alt=\" email marketing \" \/><\/p>\n<p>If there is one thing that has the power to make or break you, I\u2019ll let email marketing take the trophy. When you use an email newsletter to promote yourself and gain traffic, either of these two things happens.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You do it astonishingly well and it all works out according to plan.<\/li>\n<li>Your customers mark your emails as spam, delete, and never come back. Which means the plan went horrendously awry.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you look at email marketing as visiting someone\u2019s house, you might be able to get a clearer picture. You not only are on your best behavior, but you make a conscious effort to not annoy the daylights out of your host.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to continuously bombard your clients with emails and newsletter with stock full of information pushing them to buy your products. What you want to do instead, is to keep a realistic email schedule, stick to it, and provide useful information and links to pages on your website that would interest your client. Another great strategy that will increase the chances of your email to be read, is to use catchy subject lines.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Content Transformation &#8211; The Second Act<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/1_image4.jpg\" alt=\" content transformation \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Everything eventually, comes back into style. While this may sound right of a success manual in the fashion industry, the same is true for marketing and business.<\/p>\n<p>This is also one of the most powerful strategies to increase traffic and user engagement, in the shortest amount of time, without actually coming up with new content. The simple idea behind<br \/>\nit is that businesses and marketers invest copious amounts of money in coming up with valuable digital content to promote their businesses, it\u2019s only fair to try and get away with using it twice.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re still wondering what content transformation is, let me lay it out for you very simply. All you do is take something you posted enough time ago that people may have forgotten about it, spruce it up, refashion it into a different form, for example, make a blog post into a video or an infographic, update the information and post it.<\/p>\n<p>The idea lies around the neighborhood of making an old dress look attractive again.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Blogger Outreach &#8211; Almost celebrity status!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/1_image8.jpg\" alt=\" blogger outreach \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bloggers and influencers are HUGE on the internet right now. They are the newest kind of celebrities with often, at least a few million followers. Why is this important to you? You can use their fame! Ethically, of course. All you need to do is find an influencer to run a promotional post on your product, or share some of your content and BOOM! You are instantly bombarded with an unglodly abundance of visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Now finding an influential person to endorse your product, used to be a difficult feat. The great news of the current moment in time is, that the task is now peanuts. Literally.<\/p>\n<p>Influencers are everywhere, and if they like your stuff, they will be happy to promote it.<\/p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1522050470846_89726\">If in case, you end up not finding a blogger or influencer, you can always turn to \u201cInfluencer Marketplaces\u201d like \u201c<a id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1522050470846_89816\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tribegroup.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.tribegroup.co\/\">Tribe Group<\/a>\u201d or \u201c<a id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1522050470846_90492\" href=\"https:\/\/famebit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/famebit.com\/\">FameBit<\/a>\u201d, and connect with people who are actually already interested in promoting content.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1522050470846_91348\"><strong id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1522050470846_91347\">5. Post content to LinkedIn &#8211; Old is Gold<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/18_image3.png\" alt=\" linkedin marketing \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Looking for yet another social media platform in search of good traffic? Go down the good old memory lane. Gone are the days when LinkedIn was nothing more than a marketplace for jobs that you turned to look for new options and opportunities. It\u2019s now a fully functional professional social media that even allows you to post content regularly, and like any other platform, there is a high chance that <strong>like-minded people will read it!<\/strong> Which also means that <strong>LinkedIn is a goldmine for quality traffic!<\/strong> \u00a0Ever thought about it that way? You probably hadn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Monitor your Analytics Data &#8211; Do it!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2_image5.jpg\" alt=\" analytics \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now I know, I know, I promised a non-technical list, I know! but in my defense, this particular point is too important to be left out of this post and you don\u2019t even have to do it yourself. There are agencies, <a href=\"https:\/\/go.marketlytics.com\/analytics-for-agencies\">much like ours<\/a>, who can do this for you very well.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard about <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/how-to-install-google-analytics\">Google Analytics<\/a>, which is unlikely but just in case you really haven\u2019t, it\u2019s this incredibly powerful tool that you can use to measure how your website is performing, to put it in a very, very, small nutshell. This is imperative because it will make sure you know what is working great and what isn\u2019t doing so well and what you need to improve and focus on more.<\/p>\n<p>So it will end up saving you a lot of time, effort,\u00a0and money invested in all the wrong places and let you know what you really, really should be working on, and what is fine as it is.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. Follow a good marketing strategy &#8211; OR CREATE ONE!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image7.jpg\" alt=\" marketing strategy \" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is where many a great business has failed to move forward. Either of these two things happened to them.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>They either didn\u2019t have a content marketing strategy. At all. OR<\/li>\n<li>They had a questionably terrible one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You can literally follow all the steps mentioned here, or all the little tips and tricks you can scoop up from the internet, but nothing would really work as well as you would want it to, if you go through your marketing campaign like a hurricane hit it.<\/p>\n<p>A good content marketing strategy would ideally detail out everything from the purpose of your campaign, your target audience and everything about it, differentiation points of your content from your competitors, your schedule and frequency of posting, \u00a0and all the forms of your content. Create an excellent one, and you\u2019re golden.<\/p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s about it for today\u2019s post. If you have any other, non-technical and easy strategies to increase traffic to your site, that work for you, we\u2019d love to hear about them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn the 7 proven ways to double your website traffic in 2018.
