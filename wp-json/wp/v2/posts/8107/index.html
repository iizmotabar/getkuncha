If a form is submitted, it will be counted as a goal conversion and also as an event. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">However, if you decide to resubmit the form because you thought you filled it wrong the first time, for example, the re-submitted form will still be counted as a single goal conversion but the total number of events will be considered as two.
