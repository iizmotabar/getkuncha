Similarly, Mixpanel is based on two main features events, properties and profiles, used to track individual users.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1). Events <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Events are all kinds of actions \u00a0which users carry out on your website or app. To get started, Mixpanel recommends setting up at least five events, a single key metric and five other events to create your conversion funnel.<\/p>\n<p>To create an event, you would have to write a piece of code that will send event information to Mixpanel. Below is an example code to track a video on your site.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"source-code\"><span class=\"cm-tag cm-bracket\">&lt;<\/span><span class=\"cm-tag\">script<\/span> <span class=\"cm-attribute\">type<\/span>=<span class=\"cm-string\">\"text\/javascript\"<\/span><span class=\"cm-tag cm-bracket\">&gt;<\/span>\n    <span class=\"cm-variable\">mixpanel<\/span>.<span class=\"cm-property\">track<\/span>(<span class=\"cm-string\">\"Video played\"<\/span>, {\n        <span class=\"cm-string cm-property\">\"Video length\"<\/span>: <span class=\"cm-number\">213<\/span>,\n        <span class=\"cm-string cm-property\">\"id\"<\/span>: <span class=\"cm-string\">\"hY7gQr0\"<\/span>\n    });\n<span class=\"cm-tag cm-bracket\">&lt;\/<\/span><span class=\"cm-tag\">script<\/span><span class=\"cm-tag cm-bracket\">&gt;<\/span><\/pre>\n<p>After adding the event code on your site, you can immediately see the results by carrying out that \u00a0event and look at live reports or create a separate segment.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2).Properties<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A property in Mixpanel is extra information which describes an event. A property may vary according to your business type. For example, if you are tracking video play as an event, the property could be the type or length of the video.<\/p>\n<p>Properties can be sent as a key:value pair<\/p>\n<p><strong>{\u201cvideo type\u201d:\u201dmp4\u201d, \u201cage\u201d:34, \u201cgender\u201d:\u201dmale\u201d}<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3).Profiles<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A profile in Mixpanel ties up properties with individual users. By creating a profile, you can store user information like email, gender, age and when they sign up. You can then create segments for profiles with similar characteristics and target them using email notifications from within your Mixpanel account.<\/p>\n<p>You can follow this guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/mixpanel.com\/help\/reference\/creating-a-profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">create your first profile in Mixpanel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to View Reports in Mixpanel<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Mixpanel doesn\u2019t provide plentiful reports like Google Analytics, instead revolves \u00a0around tracking individual users and their actions.
