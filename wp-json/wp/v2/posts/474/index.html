So as long as you fit in with the nature of work here, you\u2019re most welcome to apply!<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">One-Pagers<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Try to make it all fit a single page.<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tidy Templates<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Make sure you use a neat and tidy template and clear font to create your resume.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>Step 2: The Review<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Once you\u2019ve sent in your CV, the next step is to just hold on and wait while our team reviews your application. Since we\u2019re in hyper-growth right now, it\u2019s important to understand that this step can take upto two to three weeks. Listed in the following are the things we look for.<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Relevant skills (or openness to learn)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Relevant experience<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Academic and professional exposure<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage28229.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>Step 3: The Interview<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">This is the most important step of all. Once we have reviewed your application, we\u2019ll call you in for an interview if we feel that you\u2019d be a good fit for our team. We\u2019re fortunate that a lot of talented individuals want to be a part of our team, but this also means that we are mostly only able to follow up with the ones who closely match what we are looking for. If you don\u2019t get a call, please don\u2019t be disheartened, it only means that you might be a great fit for another prestigious organization, instead of us, and we wish you our best.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">If you get a call from us, here\u2019s a piece of advice, the interview can take upto 3 hours, so make sure you prepare well, have a good breakfast, and show up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Your interview day will consist of two main stages.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Prep Stage and the Interview Stage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong><em>The Prep Stage<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The first step of the interview comprises of reading through material that we\u2019d give you and see how much of it you understand. In case something doesn\u2019t make sense, you\u2019re allowed to search the internet. This step also consists of a few open ended questions about yourself, just to gauge your vision and career plans.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong><em>The Interview Stage<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Next, is the actual interview round where your understanding of the material provided to you will be tested. The questions asked will probe your knowledge for deeper understanding, in a scenario based context.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Example Question<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><em>If channel X equally assists and initiates in conversions, what would it\u2019s last interaction conversion be?<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The questions will range from a difficulty level 0 to a full 10. You might be asked to comment on a certain concept, recognize flaws in things and even suggest something better. This is only so we can get a handle of the level and nature of work you\u2019d be fit for, so don\u2019t be nervous, when you get asked difficult things. Another thing to keep in mind is that we are interested in reasoning and how you arrive at a conclusion, more so, your thought process. We encourage asking questions of your interviewer, and asking them to clarify if there\u2019s a question you don\u2019t understand. We prefer interview sessions to be more of a discussion than a round of rapid fire.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Example Question<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><em>In analytics reports, we sometimes get a lot of spam data. How would you deal with this issue?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/interview.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>Step 4: In office work assignment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">If you clear the interview round, you\u2019ve officially entered phase 2 of our hiring process. A big congratulations from the ML team!<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The in-office round would simply require you to show up at office and complete a list of tasks assigned to you. You will be given a week before your scheduled dates, to prepare yourself, with the help of a collection of the most relevant study material and tutorials that will be provided to you via email.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The goal for the in-office assignment is to show you how we work, what work we do, and give you a chance to decide if this would be a good fit for you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I\u2019ll take a minute again to remind you to not get tensed if there\u2019s a term you don\u2019t understand or a formula you forgot. You\u2019re free to take help from the internet whenever you want. That being said, Good Luck with the assignment!<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>Step 5: The Final Interview<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">At the end of your office assignment, comes the final interview. This interview is to mainly discuss the position and work we think you\u2019re best fit for. Keep it mind, that sometimes, it may be slightly different from the position you applied for. This is because we believe strongly that the happiest employees, are the ones whose work compliments their talents, and our rigorous hiring procedure, helps us greatly in determining your strongest areas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Once you\u2019re through with the interview, you\u2019re in.
