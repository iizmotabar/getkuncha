For example, if a user navigates to another page or triggers an event. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">Two things could be causing the bounce rate to fall after you implement GTM; one good and one bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">When you implemented GTM, you did not remove the old GA code that was added to your site directly. This would result in double counting of each pageview reducing your bounce rate. This can be fixed by removing the GA code.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">There are some events that are triggered without a user doing an action. For example: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">When a popup loads. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">When an item comes into view. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">Tracking visit to specific pages. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">Recording banner impressions on landing pages etc. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.3333px\">For these event tags, Google Analytics allow setting them to Non-Interaction (not have an effect on the bounce rate of site). <\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you are seeing a drop in bounce rate after implementing google tag manager, you should follow the steps explained here to resolve it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":1663,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[26,66],"acf":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8105"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8105"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8105\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1663"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8105"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8105"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8105"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
