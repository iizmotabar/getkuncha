Whether you\u2019re a CEO, marketing expert, or a product manager, you likely need help a of data analytics consultant because you faced these problems while analyzing data:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. You get confused with the information from analytics, especially if some of the results don\u2019t match your real sales numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Even if you can extract data into a more transparent form (a sheet, for example), you\u2019re not 100% sure if the results are accurate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. You\u2019re unsure which data is more important to analyze than the rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Most importantly, you lost a ton of time. Your more important tasks are waiting while you\u2019re wasting days\/weeks in data analysis. And on top of that, you\u2019re not even sure you\u2019re on the right track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s where data analytics consultants jump in. Their job is to help you extract and prioritize your data, show solutions to potential problems, and finally, give you insights on how to do it yourself in the future while not losing your precious time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, to make you more productive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does a data analytics consultant do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among many responsibilities (that I\u2019ll mention in the next section), a few primary things set up the foundation of a data analytics consultant\u2019s work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1-1024x536.png\" alt=\"data-analytics-consultant\" class=\"wp-image-9789\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1-1024x536.png 1024w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1-300x157.png 300w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1-768x402.png 768w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Understanding business needs&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they have a thorough conversation with the company&#8217;s CEO or marketing managers and ask what problems they face. Also, they ask about solutions the client is using to fix these problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s typically the starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Common example:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re an ecommerce owner and struggle to define the complete customer journey. Besides the final touchpoint before converting, you want to know through which channels a lead went through before landing to the last touchpoint.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then a data analytics consultant comes in, analyzes all the relevant data, and shows you which channels deserve the most credit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Exploring the data sources<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all companies store their data in multiple places \u2013 order management systems, customer service platforms, ad platforms, or others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data analytics consultant examines this data to provide answers to questions companies need.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Common example:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have plenty of data sources, and results somehow do not match. Don\u2019t worry; it happens pretty often. After addressing these gaps and analyzing all the data, the consultant will be able to show you precisely the truth behind all these results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Extracting data and organizing information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the initial data analysis, they set up different hypotheses. The ultimate goal is to understand why problems are happening.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data analytics consultant summarizes the information and shares opportunities to improve outcomes or recommendations on what the data can help with, so the CEO or other people within the company could better understand it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Common example:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a marketer, you might lose a lot of people in the funnel. So you want to know who are the people you\u2019re losing, who are people that actually become conversions, and what are the ways to improve the whole funnel to create more conversions (what steps can you add\/skip, who you should be targeting in the future, and much more).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, all the answers come from customer data. If there is a pricing problem (your competitor\u2019s product is cheaper), expert customer analysis will give you all the possible solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Automating the process<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;re sure that their professional analysis is on point, the next step is to make it easier for you to do it independently. Data analytics consultant will help you build automatic reports and dashboards or set up alerts so you can immediately notice when something important happens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Common example:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of our work is data engineering &#8211; building a system that&#8217;ll get you data in a suitable format. Besides extracting and analyzing data, data consultants will also help you automate the whole process. That will make it easier for you to look at the data and understand it correctly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data analysts or data engineers only work on their specific duties and tasks. On the other hand, data analytics consultants like me understand the complete picture, depending on clients&#8217; needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A list of customer data analytics consultant responsibilities<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, after I mentioned all the essential points of our work, let\u2019s quickly list (almost) all the responsibilities. So, here\u2019s what data analytics consultants bring to the table:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Addressing gaps in customer journeys<\/li><li>Evaluating potential problems and opportunities<\/li><li>Following protocols for processing confidential data<\/li><li>Creating reports, data visualizations, and dashboards<\/li><li>Providing technical expertise on how to store your data<\/li><li>Building the suitable attribution models<\/li><li>Giving valuable insights on what are the most important focus points for your attribution<\/li><li>Helping you understand why you should give more priority to a particular channel or why one campaign is more critical than others<\/li><li>Helping you take action for example, helping you target the right customers in marketing platforms.<\/li><li>And much, much more<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can schedule a <a href=\"https:\/\/calendly.com\/taimurahmed\">free strategy call<\/a> with us with no hard strings attached.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can marketers benefit from data analytics consultant services?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a marketer, you have one big goal \u2013 to bring leads to the product or service and improve the conversion rate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see how data analytics consultants can help you get these results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/2-1024x536.png\" alt=\"data-analytics-consultant\" class=\"wp-image-9790\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/2-1024x536.png 1024w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/2-300x157.png 300w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/2-768x402.png 768w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/2.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Have a better performance visibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You must know how all your efforts are performing on all channels. That way, it\u2019ll be much easier for you to improve the results and outcomes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Metrics such as <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/calculate-lifetime-value-google-analytics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer lifetime value<\/a> (CLV) can help you achieve that goal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Send the data from GA back to the each channel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook, Google ads, or any other platform you\u2019re using now has more intelligent systems. So once data analytics consultants help you get the right data results, you can implement them into these platforms for better outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, these results can help you do better and more narrow targeting or retargeting to improve the conversion rate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Understand who is the better customer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, by looking at the user behavior, data analytics consultants will tell you which group of people is more likely to buy so that you can pay more attention to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial for marketers since you have to reduce the number of lost leads and put more effort into those with higher conversion potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can product managers benefit from data analytics consultant services?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike marketers that want to bring leads to the product or service, product managers are interested in keeping people using the particular product.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned before, a data analytics consultant will first talk with product managers about their challenges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What are the problems you\u2019re currently facing?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What are you focused on primarily right now?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Is it onboarding, upselling the product, or something else?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After receiving that information, they\u2019ll be able to analyze your customers and their behavior and determine the hidden benefits you can get from that data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3-1024x536.png\" alt=\"data-analytics-consultant\" class=\"wp-image-9791\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3-1024x536.png 1024w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3-300x157.png 300w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3-768x402.png 768w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/3.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Understand how engaged the user is<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, data analytics consultants can give you the answers to the most critical questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What features do customers use the most?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Where do they get stuck?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What causes them to keep using your product?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What causes them to upgrade to a more expensive pricing plan?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, they are primarily focused on collecting information about user behavior, both within the app and website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Predict retention and churn<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Retention and churn are two key terms on the mind of a product manager. So, without using data correctly, it\u2019s almost impossible to improve the retention rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, by analyzing user behavior and other relevant metrics, data analytics consultants can show you precisely what feature in your tool\/app has to be improved to make more users happy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, don\u2019t forget to talk about your product with existing users. Combining their answers with data is the winning combination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Get the right information out of database<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every digital product has a database, which stores information about users (basic and more complex data). Even if you don\u2019t have a digital analytics platform, data analytics consultants can still help you understand your customer using your own database. Or otherwise enrich the data you have in your analytics platform with user attributes from your database.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can help you get all the critical data out of it. For example, how many times is a user logging in during a week\/month, what features are they using, and much more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterward, they simplify that information so you can better understand each group of your users. Of course, there will be more engaged groups and those with higher churn chances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final verdict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the final takeaways on how marketers and product managers can benefit from data consultant services:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. As a marketer, you\u2019ll have better visibility of your efforts and have a clear picture of what parts of the funnel need to be improved to boost conversion rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. As a product manager, you need all the relevant data on user behavior to improve the retention rate and user experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Since I\u2019ve worked with many product managers and marketers for a long time, I\u2019ve already seen the problems you\u2019re facing multiple times. So for me, after all these years, it\u2019s easy to spot potential issues and offer you effective solutions to fix them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. When working with any technical person, you have to be very specific about what you need from them. It usually takes a lot of time, which is not the case when working with data consultants. I already know how things work from a business perspective, which makes a massive difference in problem-solving.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, I offer both technical and business expertise, resulting in better solutions and less time spent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"poptin-embedded\" data-id=\"524d62d316aa4\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 extracting and analyzing the data from Google Analytics and other analytics platforms is a complex and dull task for most people.
