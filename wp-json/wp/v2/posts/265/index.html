The interaction might be a form submission, video play, button click or a pdf download.<\/p>\n<figure >\n<blockquote><p>\n    <span>&#8220;<\/span>Events are user interactions with content that can be tracked independently from a web page or a screen load.<span>&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n  <\/blockquote><figcaption class=\"source\">&mdash; Google<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But why exactly we need to look after what each user is upto? Tracking user activity can majorly help analysts to determine how and what triggers a specific action or using a more relevant term, conversions.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you are looking for an easy way tracking method, you should consider using Google Tag Manager for Event Tracking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>With Google Tag Manager, you can catch each user action, and do so in the simplest manner. GTM eliminated the need of hard-coding every activity or event you want to track. Just assign a tag to static-ish attributes like IDs and URLs so that they are less prone to changes and each time a user interacts with that attribute, a corresponding tag is fired. For entities with no such components that can hold a tag, there is always the Data Layer Event Code approach.<\/p>\n<p>This article will help you use Google Tag Manager for event tracking and by the end, you will be able to track outbound links, form submissions and pdf downloads in google tag manager.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<p>\n      <b>Index<\/b>\n  <\/p>\n<li><a href=\"#event-tracking-comparision\">Event Tracking in Google Analytics vs Tag Manager<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gtm-terms\">Understanding The GTM Components<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#examples\">Google Tag Manager Event Examples<\/a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#outbound-links\">Tracking Outbound Links<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#form-submission\">Tracking Succesful Form Submissions<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#pdf-download\">Tracking PDF Downloads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#scroll-depth\">Tracking Scroll Depth<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"event-tracking-comparision\">\n  <b>Google Analytics Event Tracking vs Tag Manager Events<\/b><br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you are using Google Tag Manager or Google Analytics for event tracking, the end result would always be the same. The only difference is of the method both tools use for tracking events. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Setting up event tracking in google analytics always requires a change in javascript code snippet and if you are not too familiar with coding, you\u2019d have to rely on a developer.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, event tracking in google tag manager frees you from modifying code every time you want to track something. Once, you setup GTM you would only be playing around with tags and triggers.<\/p>\n<p>GTM is all about managing tags from a single place and triggering them on specific actions. At the first glance, google tag manager might seem a little complicated but actually, it is ranked as the easiest tag managing system by data analysts so far.<\/p>\n<p>If you have ever tried event tracking in google analytics, you would know that the code snippet {ga(\u201csend\u201d, \u201cevent\u201d,\u201dcategory\u201d, \u201caction\u201d,\u201dlabel\u201d)} sends information about the event to google analytics.<\/p>\n<figure >\n<blockquote><p>\n    <span>&#8220;<\/span>Google Tag Manager only fires tags in response to events.<span>&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n  <\/blockquote><figcaption class=\"source\">&mdash; Google<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>While using Google Tag Manager, a few mouse clicks will get the &nbsp;job done in a few minutes. If you aren\u2019t aware of the powers GTM has got, I suggest you go through <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/what-does-google-tag-manager-do\">what google tag manager can do<\/a> for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One important thing you need to understand here is, Google Tag Manager events are different than you see in Google Analytics. Events in GTM tells when a user actions happens, based on this we can trigger any tags(google analytics, adwords or custom html) or do nothing at all. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"gtm-terms\">\n  <b>Google Tag Manager Components<\/b><br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Many of you might not be familiar enough with google tag manager interface. So, before getting started with the &nbsp;real examples of event tracking, you should familiarize yourself with few key components of GTM.<\/p>\n<figure >\n<blockquote><p>\n    <span>&#8220;<\/span>Google Tag Manager uses \u201ctriggers\u201d, \u201cvariables\u201d and a \u201cdata layer\u201d to set up the firing of tags on your website or mobile app.<span>&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n  <\/blockquote><figcaption class=\"source\">&mdash; Google<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Tags <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A tag is a code snippet which executes on a set of pages and is controlled by a single interface instead of adding codes directly to webpage. The purpose of tags is to send information to third party applications and tools. For example, a google analytics pageview tag sends your site activity to Google. Similarly an event tag will send event attribute data to google analytics. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Triggers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A trigger is a condition that should &nbsp;respond with either a true or a false during runtime. In GTM, you can not create a tag without creating the corresponding trigger first. You can either create the trigger while configuring a tag or from the triggers menu. But it is recommended to create the trigger before setting up the tag. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Variables<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A variable in GTM is a name-value pair for which the value is generated during run time. For instance, the variable Page URL will always contain the current page URL and the Page Hostname will always contain the hostname for current page.<\/p>\n<p>You can read more about tags, triggers and variables <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/tagmanager\/answer\/6103657?hl=en\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"examples\">\n  <b>Google Analytics Events Tracking in Tag Manager<br \/>\n<\/b><br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>To help you understand more about creating google analytics events in google tag manager, let\u2019s take a look at some real examples. But before doing anything further, make sure you have all built-in variables(Pages, Clicks, Forms ) enabled in GTM. You can do this by navigating to workspace &gt;&gt; variables &gt;&gt; built-in variables and clicking on the configure button.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/213_image-asset.png\" alt=\" enable built-in variables \"\/><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"outbound-links\">\n  <b>1. Tracking Outbound Links in Google Tag Manager<\/b><br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>For tracking any outbound link on your site, follow the steps below:<\/p>\n<p>Step1: login to GTM and select the specific account<\/p>\n<p>Step2: Create a new tag in google tag manager<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2_create-a-new-tag.png\" alt=\" create a new tag \"\/><\/p>\n<p>Step3: Enter the tag name as \u201cOutbound Links\u201d, click on tag configuration and select universal analytics as the tag type.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/214_image-asset.png\" alt=\" tag configuration \"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step4: Fill the tag configuration data. <\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Enter the tracking ID.

In this case,&nbsp;we didn\u2019t created any trigger before, so we will create a new trigger. Follow the below steps to create trigger for outbound links.<\/p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;From the pop up window, click on the plus(+) icon on the top right of the window.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/216_image-asset.png\" alt=\" create a new trigger \"\/><\/p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;Enter the trigger name as <strong>Outbound Link Click<\/strong>, click on the tag configuration and select the trigger type as <strong>Just Links<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/217_image-asset.png\" alt=\" configure outbound tracking tag \"\/><\/p>\n<p>3. Select both checkboxes i.e wait for tags and check validation.<\/p>\n<p>4. Enable the trigger when matches regex \u2018.*\u2019. This means the trigger is enabled on all pages of your site. Learn more about regex <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/regex101.com\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/218_image-asset.png\" alt=\" matches regex \"\/><\/p>\n<p>5. Control the trigger to only fire on links that points to a different website. You will have to set the filter to fire when \u2018Click URL does not contain www.yourdomain.com\u2019. This is a very simple method to apply filter. You can also do this by entering regex or creating a new variable and passing your domain name as the value.<\/p>\n<p>Your final trigger should look similar to<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/219_image-asset.png\" alt=\" outbound link trigger \"\/><\/p>\n<p>Save the trigger and then the tag.<\/p>\n<p>Step6: Finally, preview and debug the new tag. From the publish drop down menu, click on preview button. Open your website in a new tab and click on an outbound link. If the outbound link fires, go back to tag manager, leave the preview mode and publish the tag.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/220_image-asset.png\" alt=\" tag manager preview mode \"\/><\/p>\n<p>You are done!<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"form-submission\">\n  <b>2.
