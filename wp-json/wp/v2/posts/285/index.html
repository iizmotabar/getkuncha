If Sheets are meeting your end goals you don\u2019t really need to switch to Looker Studio. But, Looker Studio is built on top of Sheets with some extra amazing features. Below are few of the differences between Looker Studio &amp; Google Sheets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/115_image-asset.png\" alt=\" difference between data studio and sheets \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Looker Studio Home Screen<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started with creating reports in Looker Studio, you don\u2019t need to fill out any registration form like Google Analytics or Adwords. It only requires an active Google Account. If you are already using any Google product like Google Analytics or Adwords, use the same account for Looker Studio so you can easily connect to any Google data source.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already signed in to your Gmail account, type <a href=\"https:\/\/lookerstudio.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">lookerstudio.google.com<\/a> in a new tab. This will directly take you to the Looker Studio\u2019s homepage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/116_image-asset.png\" alt=\" datastudio home page \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to build an awesome report like a boss!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/contact-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"384\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Google-Data-Studio-Expert-1024x384.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10793\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Google-Data-Studio-Expert-1024x384.png 1024w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Google-Data-Studio-Expert-300x113.png 300w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Google-Data-Studio-Expert-768x288.png 768w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Google-Data-Studio-Expert-1536x576.png 1536w, https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Google-Data-Studio-Expert-2048x768.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Google Docs and Sheets, Looker Studio comes with a few built-in templates to get started with. You can either choose an existing template and modify it or just start with a blank new report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on the \u201cAll Templates\u201d drop-down displays all built-in templates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/117_image-asset.png\" alt=\" data studio templates \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose any template that matches your requirements and modify anything you need to change using the editor. Pre-built templates are useful for people with busy schedules as ready-to-go features can save a lot of time..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the sake of your learning, we are going to start with a blank report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before that, let\u2019s overview the Looker Studio\u2019s homepage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to start with a new report. First is by clicking on the blank plus (+) page on the horizontal header and second is by clicking on the plus icon from the bottom right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/118_image-asset.png\" alt=\" start a new report data studio \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the homepage you can view sample reports, reports owned by you and those shared with you. Looker studio has got a bin that contains your deleted reports, so you can either restore it \u00a0or delete it permanently by emptying the bin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The navigation menu will help you switch between multiple reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/119_image-asset.png\" alt=\" switch between reports\u00a0 \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The sidebar menu on the homepage will take you to see the data sources, new features and video tutorial for learning Looker Studio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/120_image-asset.png\" alt=\" home screen sidebar \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The homepage also has a \u00a0few sample reports to help you understand how your final reports will look like. Click on any sample report to see how Looker Studio displays data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/121_image-asset.png\" alt=\" data studio sample reports \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the search bar comes in handy when your homepage is flooded with reports and when it\u2019s difficult to find a specific one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also sort the reports by name, recently viewed, the last modified, or just the order in which the reports were created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on the AZ dropdown beside the search bar will help you sort the reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/122_image-asset.png\" alt=\" search and sort reports \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Build Your First Report in Looker Studio<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To create your first report, use the methods I mentioned above. Clicking the new report button will display a pop up window with a welcome message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on the get started button on the welcome page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/123_image-asset.png\" alt=\" data studio welcome message \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Accept the terms &amp; conditions and then choose if you want to subscribe the Looker Studio\u2019s newsletter and hit the \u201cFinished\u201d button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now click on the new report button again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Create a Data Source \/ Connect Google Analytics<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter a name for your report which by default is named as \u201cuntitled\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I stated at the beginning that Data Studio extracts data from an external data source. So, you\u2019d have to connect to a separate source that provides data to build a report like GA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the right sidebar, you can either select a sample data source or create a new one. But most of users always prefer creating a new data source,&nbsp;so find the \u201cCREATE NEW DATA SOURCE\u201d button if you are one of those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can either upload a data file or select a source like Google Analytics, BigQuery, Adwords, YouTube etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case, I am connecting to Google Analytics because it contains all my website data and I could really use an attractive interface to organize my data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have selected a specific account, property, and view- click the connect button. Next, you will see the list of metrics and dimensions you can add to the report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fields in green are dimensions and in blue are metrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add a new calculated field to the list, click the plus icon, name the custom field and enter the formula for the calculated metric or dimension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, just click the \u201cADD TO REPORT\u201d button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you will be taken to the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/createanewreport.gif\" alt=\" how to create a new data studio report \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Components of Reports Creating Area<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t remember doodling and sketching sceneries in windows paint? So by your 3rd or 4th grade, \u00a0almost everybody learned specific tools and dragging the mouse to draw shapes. In the same way, Looker Studio lets you create reports by selecting a tool and then dragging the mouse around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But prior to get started with report building, you need to familiarize yourself with different tools and settings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Toolbar<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/toolbar.png\" alt=\" toolbar \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top bar highlighted in red, the toolbar which allows you to choose among various tools, pages and control options. This toolbar is divided into 5 sections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>a) Add a page<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looker Studio lets you add multiple pages to a single report. This allows you to group similar reports on each page or have a long report by creating multiple pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/124_image-asset.png\" alt=\" add page data studio \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>b) Selection mode\/undo\/redo<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/125_image-asset.png\" alt=\" undo &amp; redo changes \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great part of Looker Studio is the undo and redo buttons. You can easily switch between your last and next modifications..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>c) Types of data visualization<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/126_image-asset.png\" alt=\" data visualization tools \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are multiple types of data visualization tools. You can display your data with a pie chart, a graph, a table or geo map. This section contains the tools to display your data in multiple formats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>d) Add a text\/image\/rectangle\/circle<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/127_image-asset.png\" alt=\" ad an image \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To make your reports easy to understand, you can add a title or your company\u2019s logo to the report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>e) Controllers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/data-controllers.png\" alt=\" control selectors \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With controllers, you can add date range, add filters and switch between multiple analytics accounts. From left to right are, date change, filter control, and data control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have multiple analytics accounts, you can use data control to view data from other accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.&nbsp;The Editor<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To design a report, select a visualization type from the tools,&nbsp;and on the editor click and drag your mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/editareport.gif\" alt=\" create a dashboard \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To delete a report click the one you want to discard and press the delete\/backspace button on your keyboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.&nbsp;Select Layout &amp; Theme<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set a layout or theme for your overall reports either before you start the process or in the middle of it. You can change the theme background, or text color for all reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will gradually learn these kind of stuff once you get into it. There are a lot of features you can explore by fiddling with options in the sidebar table but as of now, I am covering only the primary ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/128_image-asset.png\" alt=\" styling layout \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Styling and controlling menu<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also juggle with your data and apply styling. To do this, select a report and from the sidebar under the data column you can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Change the chart type<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select a different data source<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add or change a dimension<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add or change a metric<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose a default date range<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apply filter<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add a Google Analytics segment<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/129_image-asset.png\" alt=\" table properties \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sharing is Caring<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing reports in Looker Studio is quite flexible and easy. You can share them like you do with your Google Docs or Sheets. To share a report click on the share icon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/130_image-asset.png\" alt=\" share data studio reports \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the email address of the person you want to share it with and select if he\/she can edit or just view the reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/131_image-asset.png\" alt=\" share with multiple email ids \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note: <\/strong>only you are allowed to delete this report and not the individuals you are sharing it with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uptil now, you have learned how to draw reports in Looker Studio. Now it\u2019s your turn to create some appealing and organized reports with your bulk of data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Advanced Looker Studio Tips<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So far you have learned the most simple and basic ways of building reports but if you want to explore a few advanced options, I have mentioned some below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add New Dimensions and Metrics with Calculated Fields<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Calculated fields allow you to control the information contained in your data source. You can add a apply mathematical formulas, transform text and return data based on logical comparisons. For more information about calculated fields click <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/datastudio\/answer\/6299685?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Setting a default date range<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know that Google Analytics has a default date range of last 30 days and we can\u2019t change it. But in Looker Studio you can change the default date settings to today, yesterday or last 30 days. To do so;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add date control to your report<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the date selector<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now from the sidebar menu under data column, click on the default date range drop down<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/132_image-asset.png\" alt=\" add date tool to report \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, click on the date drop down and change your default date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/133_image-asset.png\" alt=\" set default date range \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now the next time you open this report, it will display data according to your preset date range. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Group Multiple Reports<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This functionality is very useful in Looker Studio. This helps when you want to apply filters to selected reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, select the reports which you want to group by pressing the CTRL\/Command button and clicking on the reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are done with that, right click and select &nbsp;\u201cGroup\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/groupmultipledashboards.gif\" alt=\" group reports \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This setting allows you to apply filters to a specific set of reports only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Aligning reports inline<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your reports are scattered, your readers are most likely to overlook hem, even if the data is highly essential. The best part of building reports is to align them in a way they can easily be comprehended..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, here are a few reports you can say are a bit disoriented and can use some alignment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To align them properly in a single line, select all the reports and from the toolbar menu, navigate to<strong> Arrange &gt;&gt; Align Vertically &gt;&gt; Align Top.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/alignvertically.gif\" alt=\" unaligned reports \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you have them aligned in a single line!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to create a widget in Looker Studio<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Data Studio a single report is also known as a widget. Think about the Google Analytics dashboard containing multiple widgets. Data Studio is quite similar to GA dashboard displaying multiple reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s learn to create a complete widget in Data Studio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Select how you want the data to be displayed in the report\/widget i.e pie chart, table, geo map etc. For now, we will create a table widget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select table from the toolbar menu and drag your mouse to draw table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/134_image-asset.png\" alt=\" add a report \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above table, the source is dimension and session is a metrics. These are the default dimensions and metrics selected for every report in data studio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> To change the dimension, click on the table. From the side bar menu under dimensions click \u201csource\u201d to change or click \u201cadd dimension\u201d to add another dimension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/135_image-asset.png\" alt=\" change dimension and metrics \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do the same to change the metric next to the dimension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply filters and segments to this widget scroll down the sidebar menu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/136_image-asset.png\" alt=\" add filters and segments \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To style the widget, click on the style tab on the sidebar menu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/137_image-asset.png\" alt=\" styling table \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

Export a Single Chart\/Table as CSV<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LookerStudio allows exporting a single table or chart in a CSV format.

To export a chart or table:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on the view tab on top right to display reports in view mode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hover over the chart or report which you want to export<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>right click and select export CSV<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/140_image-asset.png\" alt=\" export reports \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Export Whole Dashboard as PDF<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is not any internal functionality added yet, that will help you export reports as pdf. But by using a chrome extension you can do this very easily. Click on the button below to install the chrome extension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-block-button-container--center\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"medium\"><a class=\"sqs-block-button-element--medium sqs-block-button-element\" href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/google-data-studio-pdf-ex\/cmbgpgjhibpioljmaaocdommnggpecje?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DataStudio PDF Exporter<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you install the extension, open your DataStudio dashboard in view mode and reload the page.
