Even though it has a wide range of visualization options to choose from, there are still times when we want to present data in a unique way or want an additional feature in the available charts. After what seems to be an entire era of relying on Looker Studio\u2019s available charts to display our work, we can finally make our own Custom Visualizations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The new Custom Visualization Feature<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This upcoming feature in looker studio is in private beta and will allow users to create their desired visualization, embed it into their reports and share them with others! The only drawback that I consider here is that to create these visualizations, you need to have at least beginner level knowledge of coding languages like HTML, CSS and javascript. You can also use javascript libraries in your visualizations (For example; <a href=\"https:\/\/d3js.org\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">d3.js<\/span><\/a>) but the source needs to be in the main source of the visualization. External references to the libraries will not work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A guide to make and use a custom visualization is available in this <a href=\"https:\/\/codelabs.developers.google.com\/codelabs\/community-visualization\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">codelab<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These Custom Visualizations are a one-time investment. You can make one and reuse it as many times as you want in different looker studio reports. Awesome, right? But I am not done&nbsp;yet. You can also publish your custom visualizations to the Looker Studio Community by following these <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/datastudio\/visualization\/sharing\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">steps<\/span><\/a>. A few featured visualizations by The Looker Studio Community can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/datastudio\/visualization\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">here<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we did<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We at MarketLytics, love to experiment and couldn\u2019t hold back when we heard of this awesome feature being introduced by Looker Studio. Here are some of our favorite custom-built visualizations in <a href=\"https:\/\/d3js.org\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">d3.js<\/span><\/a> for the Looker Studio Community!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conversion Funnel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Link: <\/strong><a href=\"\/\/lookerstudio-visualization\/conversion-funnel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">gs:\/\/lookerstudio-visualization\/conversion-funnel<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important insights for decision makers is to know the performance of the funnel that leads to user conversion. In addition to that, they also need to know what are the pain points of their conversion funnel where users drop. For Example, if the checkout page on your ecommerce site takes a lot of time to load, or the available payment options are inconvenient and the user leaves before making a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Analytics offer such insights via it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/2520139?hl=en\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Goal Flow<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/2976313?hl=en\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Funnel Visualization<\/span><\/a> report. We thought it\u2019d be useful to have a graphical representation of a Conversion Funnel in Looker Studio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This conversion funnel represents each step of your goal as a bar. And the shaded area above each bar is the drop off rate of the user from the previous step. You can also get the respective numbers by hovering over the bars.

A <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/word-clouds-on-google-data-studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">word cloud<\/a> is a graphical representation of the frequency with which a particular text appears in your data. It is very simple, yet appealing to the eye. You get the required information right away without digging too much into the visualization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Word Clouds can be used for most of the visualizations which consist of text. For Example;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">A Word Cloud of popular search keywords of your website.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Top sources of the users on your website<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Representing most used words\/hashtags in your content website.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Getting your most popular campaigns<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Exploratory Data Analysis for your NLP problem<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We made a word cloud of popular sources by sessions using the Google Merchandise Store Data. It is built on d3.js getting the top 250 popular sources. You can explore the word cloud in this <a href=\"https:\/\/datastudio.google.com\/open\/1uo9CUGI_UPa4dzsZ0-YjcL20eJonZEG6\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">report<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/4_image2.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Requirement: <\/strong>This graph takes a dimension preferably text which contains text and a metric to measure the frequency of the dimension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Histograms with Customized Binning<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Link: <\/strong><a href=\"\/\/datastudio-visualization\/Buckets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gs:\/\/datastudio-visualization\/Buckets<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A histogram is a quick way to get information of a data distribution. It is one of the most common graphs to visualize your numeric data. They give information about the skewness, distribution and outliers which are very useful when it comes to Data Analysis. Being this useful and common, it is still not available yet in Looker Studio. But hey, we can also make one on our own! <a href=\"https:\/\/datastudio.google.com\/open\/1jSqOGX90RTUAlfuc27FvtFqC9MpknOMM\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Here<\/span><\/a> is our histogram of sessions.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/5_image3.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This histogram lets you visualize the frequency distribution of a metric. The configuration of bin width is usually intuitive so we decided to add an additional feature to our histogram which lets you increase or decrease the size of your bin by the style panel of the chart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Requirements:<\/strong> Add your required variable to measure frequency distribution as a metric for this graph and a dimension against which the metric will be distributed. You need to also enter a bucket size. By default it will be 1000 per bucket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> To try out the custom bin width feature you need to make a Looker Studio report and add the visualization link in your Community Visualization preview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cohort Analysis for User Retention<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Link: <\/strong><a href=\"\/\/lookerstudio-visualization\/user-retention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">gs:\/\/lookerstudio-visualization\/user-retention<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our most recent visualization for Looker Studio Community is the Cohort Analysis Graph for User Retention. This is the most common type of User Retention which is known as Day-N Retention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day-N Retention lets you visualize the percentage of your users who come back the next day to your website. Using this visualization you can compare your data with respect to previous days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can see if your customers are sticking up after subscribing or any repeated user behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We needed a simple 7-Day User Retention Graph which can be viewed <a href=\"https:\/\/datastudio.google.com\/open\/1FQXO-l2Srf2eM7auxaN-0H66UGE1mrUU\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">here<\/span><\/a>. You can also make one for your Monthly or Weekly Data (like in Google Analytics; Home Report showing real time data).<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/5_image1.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Requirement:<\/strong> This graph takes first dimension as data and second as a Client or User ID. You can use Users , Sessions or any other metric according to your requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to try out the above visualizations you can follow this <a href=\"https:\/\/codelabs.developers.google.com\/codelabs\/community-visualization\/#10\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">guide<\/span><\/a> and use the link mentioned with each visualization.
