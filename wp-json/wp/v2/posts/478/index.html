A measurement plan is a document that defines your business objectives in terms of measurable activities. It helps in implementing analytics tools to track the data you need to not only improve your product but also your marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>When implementing any digital analytics tool, it is necessary that you build a measurement plan. &nbsp;This plan should be shared with your entire team and also your clients respective teams.<\/p>\n<p>On MarketLytics\u2019s &nbsp;larger projects, this measurement plan is also shared with the client\u2019s marketing and development teams, where both teams are involved in implementing the analytics tool to achieve the business goals.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Outlining your business objectives &#8211; The Right Way<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Any product or website that you launch, serves a specific objective. At the end of the day, however, the biggest goal behind any business, is to generate revenue. This is why it goes without saying, that it\u2019s extremely important to outline your business objectives as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In analytics, the objective is defined as a goal. Let\u2019s say you have a SaaS product, which offers multiple plans. In this case, your key business objective would be to get user sign ups and then retaining those users to continuously use your product.<\/p>\n<p>This is the step, where you need to think and jot down your business objectives both in terms of product and marketing strategies. Because the analytics tool we are going to implement will be used for measuring those objectives.<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to SaaS business, the key objectives are a little different. You need to think in terms of revenue, churn rate, avg revenue..etc. Below is the list of major objectives for a SaaS business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/SaaS-Business-Objectives.png\" alt=\" SaaS Business Objtives \"><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Figuring out marketing needs &#8211; And Who to Market to<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The next step is to find out where your target audience lives and likes to hang out. ?
