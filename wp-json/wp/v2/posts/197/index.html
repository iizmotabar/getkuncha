To be able to benefit from this tool, it is necessary that you know the right way to install it on your website.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to WordPress, most site owners become very concerned about where and how to add the GTM tracking code. If you are one of those confused WordPress users, you are about to be taught the right way to install Google Tag Manager on your WordPress site.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of this article, you will be able to set up GTM on your site correctly and have it ready to be put to use.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Create a GTM Account<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you are new to GTM, you will have to create a new account. Follow the steps detailed below to create a new GTM account. If you already have one, you may skip this..<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <a href=\"https:\/\/tagmanager.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tagmanager.google.com<\/a> in a new tab<\/li>\n<li>Add the required details to create your account<\/li>\n<li>Enter your website name in the account name field<\/li>\n<li>Select your country from the drop-down list<\/li>\n<li>Click continue button<\/li>\n<li>Enter your website URL in the container name field<\/li>\n<li>Click web under where to use container options<\/li>\n<li>Click create to create your account<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/create-new-GTM-account.png\" alt=\" create gtm account \"><\/p>\n<p>A pop-up window will appear with GTM terms &amp; services. Click agree to continue<\/p>\n<p>After this, a second pop up will appear displaying the GTM container codes.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/GTM-code.png\" alt=\" gtm tracking code \"><\/p>\n<p>Keep this window as it is and open your WordPress dashboard in a new tab.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Adding Google Tag Manager on WordPress<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are two ways to add the GTM tracking code on your WordPress site. You can either add the GTM container code directly to the website or install a GTM plugin.<\/p>\n<p>The recommended practice is adding the GTM code directly to the WordPress code. However, in some cases, this doesn\u2019t work.<\/p>\n<p>There are few WordPress themes that do not allow the addition of external code and if you have a WooCommerce site, you will have to add the GTM plugin for setting up enhanced ecommerce tracking.<\/p>\n<p>Both methods are explained in the following.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>a) Adding GTM without a Plugin<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Your first choice should be to add the GTM code without using a plugin. To do this,<\/p>\n<p>Open your WordPress dashboard<\/p>\n<p>Navigate to <strong>appearance<\/strong><strong> &gt;&gt; editor<\/strong> from the left menu<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/editor.png\" alt=\" wordpress editor \"><\/p>\n<p>Look for <strong>header.php<\/strong> file from the list of files on the right<\/p>\n<p>If you cannot find the header.php file, look for <strong>index<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong><strong>php<\/strong> where you can see the head and body part of your website.<\/p>\n<p>Now, navigate to your GTM account and copy the first code and paste it right after the opening the head tag in the header.php file.<\/p>\n<p>Copy the second code and paste it right after the opening body tag.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/GTM-code-in-wp.png\" alt=\" addin gtm code in wordpress \"><\/p>\n<p>Click on the update button to save changes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>b) Adding GTM using a Plugin<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of plugins available to set up GTM code. But I recommend you to add any of the below two plugins because they work perfectly with almost all WordPress themes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/duracelltomi-google-tag-manager\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DuracellTomi\u2019s Google Tag Manager plugin<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Add this plugin, if you have a WooCommerce store and want to set up Google Analytics enhanced ecommerce tracking with GTM.<\/p>\n<p>If your website falls into this category, we have already covered in detail setting up <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/enhanced-ecommerce-tracking-woocommerce-gtm\">enhanced ecommerce with GTM<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/dco-insert-analytics-code\/\">DCO Insert Analytics Code plugin<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Install &amp; activate this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt;&gt; DCO Insert Analytics Code<\/strong> from the left menu<\/p>\n<p>Add the first GTM code in the head section field and the second code in the body section field just after the opening body tag.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/DCO-Insert-Analytics-Code.png\" alt=\" dco insert analytics plugin \"><\/p>\n<p>Save the changes.<\/p>\n<p>Use the second plugin on any WordPress site you have. The good thing about this plugin is that it adds the GTM code on the right place without causing issues.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Verifying GTM Installation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are multiple ways to verify GTM installation on your website. The recommended method is to verify with <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/tag-assistant-by-google\/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk?hl=en\">Google Tag Assistant<\/a>. This is a browser extension used for testing and debugging Google tracking codes.<\/p>\n<p>After installing this extension, open your website in a new tab. Click the tag assistant icon and enable it. Now, reload your page.<\/p>\n<p>Tag Assistant will display all the tracking codes added on your site. If it shows your GTM tracking id, it means the installation is done properly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/tag-assistant.png\" alt=\" google tag assistant \"><\/p>\n<p>You will see the GTM tag displayed in yellow color and showing up an error. This isn\u2019t actually an error, after adding anything in your GTM container, this will disappear automatically.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Connecting GA with GTM<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Now, if you have added the Google Tag Manager code on your website, there is no need to add the Google Analytics tracking code. You will now use, Google Tag Manager to set up analytics.<\/p>\n<p>If you are already using Google Analytics on your website and moving to GTM, make sure to follow through the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/google-tag-manager-migration-complete-guide\">GTM migration steps<\/a> to protect your data.<\/p>\n<p>If you are adding a new Google Analytics account to your website, follow the steps below:<\/p>\n<p>Follow the steps <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1008015?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> to create a new Google Analytics account, in case you don\u2019t know how to do it.<\/p>\n<p>After creating your account, navigate to admin, &amp; click property settings<\/p>\n<p>Copy the tracking ID displayed under the property settings<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/GA-tracking-Id.png\" alt=\" GA tracking id \"><\/p>\n<p>Now, jump to your tag manager account<\/p>\n<p>Create a new tag<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/create-new-tag.png\" alt=\" create a new tag \"><\/p>\n<p>Enter the tag name as \u2018GA Pageview &#8211; All Pages\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Click on the tag configuration, and select universal analytics as the tag type<\/p>\n<p>Click on the Google Analytics Settings drop-down, and click \u2018new variable\u2019 option.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/create-new-variable.png\" alt=\" create new variable \"><\/p>\n<p>On the pop-up window, enter the variable name as \u2018GA Tracking ID\u2019, and paste the tracking ID you copied earlier in the Tracking ID field.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/GA-ID.png\" alt=\" GA settings variable \"><\/p>\n<p>Save this variable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Once you have created a variable for GA tracking ID, you can use this for all GA tags you create in the future. There is no need to copy and paste the GA ID again next time.<\/p>\n<p>Click on the \u2018triggering\u2019 option under the tag configuration and select the \u2018All Pages\u2019 default variable.<\/p>\n<p>Your final, Google Analytics tag should look similar to the one below<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/GA-Pageview-tag.png\" alt=\" GA pageview tag \"><\/p>\n<p>Save this tag.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Excluding WordPress Admins<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The purpose of Google Analytics is to track the number of people who visit your website, so, it is necessary to exclude your own website visits, or internal traffic, in other words, in order for the data to remain accurate. We have already talked about excluding internal wordpress traffic in detail in a previous article, however, if you missed it, you can check it out <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/exclude-wordpress-admins-from-google-universal-analytics\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>6.
