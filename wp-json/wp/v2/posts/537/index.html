The conference is considered to be the annual meetup of Digital Marketing professionals and leaders of the Measurement industry who have been working on innovative solutions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I have always wanted to attend one of these conferences where you get a chance to meet with the top creatives around the globe, learn from them and expand your knowledge. I\u2019m hoping that day will just drop randomly into my lap one fine morning \ud83d\ude00<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But while we wait, here\u2019s something productive I did to counter my anxiety. I collected 2400 tweets from the Superweek official twitter page. This blog post (also scratched out promptly to overcome said anxiety) explains the findings of my analysis on the Superweek Tweets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2_image2.gif\" alt=\" P.S Seems like yeh-hoh-SHU-ah@AnalyticsNinja has won the Golden Punch card :D though he has not actually won it, he is such a great host. \" \/> P.S Seems like yeh-hoh-SHU-ah@AnalyticsNinja has won the Golden Punch card \ud83d\ude00 though he has not actually won it, he is such a great host.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">(Golden Punch card is awarded annually to the most innovative solution as voted by the conference participants)<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Scroll down to see the winners for Golden Punch card&#8230;!<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>Data Ingestion:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I used the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tweepy.org\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tweepy<\/span><\/a>, python library for accessing twitter API, to collect 2400 tweets from Superweek`s official twitter page under the screen name of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/supervveek\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>@<\/strong>supervveek<\/span><\/a> and stored them in a NOSQL database (MongoDB).
