The main reason for this is the fact that each of these platforms does attribution of conversions differently. Each of these ad platforms wants to take as much credit as possible so if a person clicks on an ad on any of these platforms and then purchases they will claim the conversion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">On the other hand, GA has an internal attribution model per which it gives credit of conversion to the last source used to visit the site before conversion. The model is called last non direct click [it excludes the source direct from conversion if it\u2019s the last source and there is another source prior to it].<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">So as a result, where FB is claiming credit for all 12 people that clicked the Ad, GA is giving credit to FB when this was the last source and hence the difference. Same would likely be the case with Bing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Ofcourse, deciding which of the two is the right model is a separate debate but in my experience, the truth lies somewhere between the two. By default, GA uses last non direct click model but under <\/span><strong>conversions &gt;&gt; multi channel funnels<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\"> you can also see how much conversion credit sources have had for assisting traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you are confused about the huge difference between facebook conversions and google analytics goals, learn how both gives credit of conversion to the source.
