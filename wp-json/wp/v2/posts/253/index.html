Understanding GA Hierarchy<\/b><br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>While setting up a google analytics account for tracking website traffic, you first handedly need to understand the hierarchy and the order in which analytics Accounts, properties and views work.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/250_image-asset.png\" alt=\" google analytics hierarchy \"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Account:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can have up to 100 analytics account under a single google account.<\/li>\n<li>A single account can have up to 50 properties, which means you can connect upto 50 websites to a single account.<\/li>\n<li>Each account must contain at least one property to collect your website data<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Property:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each property can have up to 25 views.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a big business you can create multiple properties to get data separately from different devices.<\/li>\n<li>You can also create multiple properties to direct a specific region or brand data to each property.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Views: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>This is where you can see traffic data and reports.<\/li>\n<li>The benefit of creating multiple views is that you can filter data to see reports for different regions or campaigns separately.<\/li>\n<li>You should always create one unfiltered view, one test view and one master view. The unfiltered view will contain all your website\u2019s raw data, the test view should be setup for testing filters and the master data will have the filtered data that will be used for analyzation.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The thing with views is that they disregard any data that was collected before they were created. Each view only includes data that flows in after they are newly created.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>If you delete a view, you can restore it within the next 30 days. But you should have the admin access to delete or restore any view.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/251_image-asset.png\" alt=\" create multiple views \"\/><\/p>\n<p>You can grant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/2884495?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">permission<\/a> to other users on each level.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"setup-goals\">\n  <b>2. Setting up goals<\/b><br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Setting up goals in google analytics should be the most important step after the google analytics installation. Goals in google analytics are used to track conversions. Your website goals may include a newsletter signup or a product purchase.<\/p>\n<p>For example, your website goal is to get more newsletter signups. After setting up this goal in analytics, every time a user signs up for newsletter, a goal will be completed. A goal completion is also called a conversion in analytics term.<\/p>\n<p>We have already discussed in detail about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/setting-custom-goals-google-analytics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">setting up goals in google analytics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"exclude-internal-traffic\">\n  <b>3. Excluding Internal Traffic<\/b><br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Google Analytics, in particular, is built for tracking external website visitors.&nbsp;Sometimes, when you or someone in your company visits your website, a hit is counted.<\/p>\n<p>This is something that is to be avoided, considering employee traffic can disrupt your analyzation reports as are they are not your actual target audience and they cannot be classified as web natural traffic.<\/p>\n<p>So, you will always want to track your target audience and not your employees or yourself. To block all the hits coming from your internal sources, there is a process known as excluding internal traffic.<\/p>\n<p>To exclude internal traffic you can follow any of the method below:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Exclude IP Address<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To exclude an internal IP address, you have to create a filter. Do you remember in which view to create the filter first? If you don\u2019t know, create the filter in the test view, verify if it works and then copy it to master view. Let\u2019s create the filter in test view.<\/p>\n<p>Navigate to analytics admin and select the test view.<\/p>\n<p>Under view menu click on filters.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/252_image-asset.png\" alt=\" create a filter \"\/><\/p>\n<p>Click on <strong>Add Filter<\/strong> button<\/p>\n<p>From the Filter settings, enter the filter name as \u201cExclude Internal IP\u2019\u201d, then select filter type as \u201cPredefined\u201d. From the filter type drop-down menu, select \u201cExclude\u201d, then from select source or destination menu, select \u201ctraffic from the IP addresses\u201d and finally select expression as \u201cthat are equal to\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Paste the IP address(if you don\u2019t know your IP address, go to google.com and search \u201cwhat is my ip\u201d) in the box underneath and Click save.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/253_image-asset.png\" alt=\" add your ip address \"\/><\/p>\n<p>Once you make sure the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1034840?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">filter works<\/a>, copy this filter to the master view. This method is mostly used when you have to exclude a single IP address.<\/p>\n<p>For excluding multiple static and dynamic IPs click <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/exclude-multiple-ips-google-analytics\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Install Opt Out Add-on<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Use this method when you have to exclude multiple IP addresses or all employees from within your company.

This will automatically exclude any hit coming from internal IPs.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"filter-bots\">\n  <b>4. Filter Bots and Spam traffic<\/b><br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>The traffic that is coming from web crawlers, bots or any other non-human source is known as spam traffic. Having a huge number of spam traffic can result in inaccurate calculations. To make future business decisions, your data should be accurate and free from any contaminations.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever you create a new view, don\u2019t forget to filter bots. To enable this in your analytics view, navigate to admin &gt;&gt; View &gt;&gt; View Settings.<\/p>\n<p>This will exclude all the known bots from your website\u2019s actual traffic.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Viewing spam traffic<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In case you ever want to monitor how much spam traffic you site is actually getting, navigate to <strong>Acquisition &gt;&gt; All Traffic &gt;&gt; Referrals<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/254_image-asset.png\" alt=\" view spam traffic \"\/><\/p>\n<p>Change the date range to at least more than two months.<\/p>\n<p>      <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/255_image-asset.png\" alt=\" change date range \"\/><\/p>\n<p>Now sort the reports by bounce rate.
