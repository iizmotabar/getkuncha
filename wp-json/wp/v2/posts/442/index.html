However, there are other, more preferable ways to display your data in order to maximize its usability and the efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I will be explaining 5 ways to visualize your data in Google Analytics that can be easily used to turn numbers into actions.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why not Use Google Data Studio?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As we all know, Google Data Studio is an awesome tool for visual reports. You might be wondering why I am still talking about GA reports when you already have Data Studio in replace.<\/p>\n<p>Although, I am a big fan of Data Studio, sometimes, it just isn\u2019t enough. When analytics itself is involved, we have to turn to Google Analytics, to accomplish what isn\u2019t possible in The Google Data Studio.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Data Studio does a pretty good job in showing you what is important to your business and give you an overview of the overall performance of your website. But when you are dealing with a critical issue like <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/bounce-rate-suddenly-drop-google-analytics\">a sudden drop in bounce rate<\/a>, data studio just wasn\u2019t created to drill down that data.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5 Ways to Visualize Data in Google Analytics<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Google Analytics offers five different visualizations to analyze your data in every report by default. The buttons to select these types are hidden away in the corner (see below). Let\u2019s move on to learn more about each method and when is best to use them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/1.png\" alt=\" google analytics data visualizations \"><\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Tabular Reports<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Tables in Google Analytics are selected as the default way to display data and is easy to understand at first glance. The first column displays a dimension and the rest shows the metrics.<\/p>\n<p>On the top left of the table, you can see a list of primary dimensions. A primary dimension is what you see in the first column.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2.png\" alt=\" primary dimensions \"><\/p>\n<p>You can add a secondary dimension to this report as well. For example, you can add a secondary dimension as \u2018source\u2019 to see the traffic source. To add the secondary dimension, click on the secondary dimension drop-down and select from the list that appears.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/3.png\" alt=\" secondary dimension \"><\/p>\n<p>The traffic source of each specific page is shown clearly, in the table above. Using the secondary dimensions, you can also go further, and into the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/filter-spam-traffic-google-analytics\">spam traffic sources, if<\/a> need be.<\/p>\n<p>You can use a filter to view a specific page on your site. To do this, enter a specific keyword from the URL into the search box.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/4.png\" alt=\" filter table data \"><\/p>\n<p>You can also use a regex expression to filter multiple pages, as well as, apply an advanced filter for including or excluding multiple pages using a regex.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/5.png\" alt=\" filter with regex \"><\/p>\n<p>The data displayed in the tabular format is easy to digest, and also, helps in seeing the overall performance of a dimension at a glance<\/p>\n<p>Changing primary dimension, adding secondary dimension and filter options are available in all visualizations.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Pie Charts<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/6.png\" alt=\" data visualization with pie chart \"><\/p>\n<p>Another useful way to analyze data in analytics are pie charts. Pie charts are easy to read and very direct in showing you your best-performing item.<\/p>\n<p>The pie chart report only consists of a single metric which makes it easier to consume and digest. For example, if you want to see the bounce rate for each page on your website, you can select the option from the drop-down on the pie type report, and the resulting pie chart will show you the bounce rate for all your pages respectively in a single display.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/7.png\" alt=\" change metric \"><\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, to see which page resulted in a high exit rate, change the bounce rate drop-down to pageviews and contribution in total to %Exit.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/12.png\" alt=\" change metrics \"><\/p>\n<p>You can further change the primary dimension, add a secondary dimension and even add a filter to reach your desired results.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Performance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at the \u2018All Pages\u2019 section to understand how we can use the performance visualization for maximum benefit.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/8.png\" alt=\" performance report \"><\/p>\n<p>As shown in the picture above, the performance report displays the total percentage of pageviews for each URL. The first column shows the total number and the second column shows the percentage contribution of a page to the total.<\/p>\n<p>You can use this report to get a feel of how well your pages are doing and what pages need some more work. Click on the drop-downs to change the metrics.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Comparison<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The fourth type of visualization is comparison which is very helpful to see how a metric is changing compared to the site average within a given date range.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to see how bounce rate is changing for each specific page, this report will help. The image below shows how the bounce rate is changing for pages with most pageviews.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/9.png\" alt=\" comparison report \"><\/p>\n<p>The negative sign with green color shows a decreasing bounce rate and the red color shows that it\u2019s increasing.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Pivot Tables<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The last type of visualization in analytics is the pivot table report. It can be used to quickly summarize data in the desired format and detect trends.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/10.png\" alt=\" pivot table \"><\/p>\n<p>There are two pivot metrics you can select at a single time and also change the primary dimension.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you want to see the performance of your online campaigns by each country.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, first select the primary dimension as &#8216;campaign&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Select the pivot by dimension as &#8216;country&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Select the pivot metrics as &#8216;unique pageviews&#8217;, and &#8216;bounce rate&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/11.png\" alt=\" pivot table data analysis \"><\/p>\n<p>The image above shows how each campaign is performing across different countries.<\/p>\n<p>You can also add a secondary dimension like device category to see which device is mostly used in different countries.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>With so many ways to analyze your data, it might get a little hard sometimes deciding which report to use, since all of them come with their own advantages and disadvantages. Some, may work better than others depending on the situation you are in.
