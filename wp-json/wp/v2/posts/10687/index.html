It\u2019s the best free tool out there that every marketer has to use, regardless of being involved in revenue attribution or not. GA is a must.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this article in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The competition among revenue attribution tools is high, but in the end, considering multiple factors (mostly unique features and functionalities), I came up with this list:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Adobe Marketo Measure (Bizible)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dreamdata<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjust<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ruler Analytics<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attribution<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in a hurry, you can review the summary table right away.<br><br><strong>Note:<\/strong> G2 is the most popular site for online reviews (especially for SaaS).
