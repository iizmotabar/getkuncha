The key purpose of this feature is to differentiate between multiple links on a single page that led to an identical location. If you have multiple links on the same page leading to the same destination, google analytics enhanced linked attribution will show which link is getting more clicks.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Benefit of Enhanced link attribution<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For instance: if you have a landing page containing two links and both directing to the home page, google analytics could tell the number of visitors directed to the home page from both the links.<\/p>\n<p>But once you enable enhanced link attribution in google analytics, you can track the number of visitors flowing to home page from each link. Not only this but, it can also tell if the link within the content is more effective or a link from a tab within the same page. You can alternately determine if a button is more effective for a link or just a text link.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to enable enhanced link attribution<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The new version of google analytics doesn\u2019t require any code changes for enhanced link attribution.
