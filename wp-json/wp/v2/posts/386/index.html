From helping clients figuring out how to do marketing or whether it\u2019s our processes internally. From how quickly we respond to emails to how much time we spend on various tasks we try to use tools to help us capture all the data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Unsurprisingly the hard part hasn\u2019t been how we collect data which we have oodles of, at this point rather how do we consistently collect and visualize it for meaningful insights. Here is how we started and the tools we used to get a fully automated way to query data from our project management tool.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>What forced us to create the teamwork connector?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Creating a teamwork connector was definitely not our one time idea. Our main goal was to have a report where we could easily see the status of tasks and time it took to complete each task. A report which also makes it easy to view the performance of each team member at a glance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">For managing tasks and recording time, we use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teamwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Teamwork<\/a>. It is a project management tool which marries task management, time tracking all from a single web interface.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Here is how we started using<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>1) \u00a0Manual Reporting within Teamwork<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Teamwork basically is a task management tool where we can create tasks and record time entries for each task. This helps us track the total time each task took to complete. We also use the logged time to measure the performance of each team member and the total hours logged each month.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/logged-time.png\" alt=\" teamwork time logs \" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Below is how a report looks like in teamwork. This is pretty helpful but without having a graphical interface it seems a little boring and hard to read.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/teamwork-interface.png\" alt=\" teamwork interface \" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">For viewing different types of reports we have to navigate to different pages. I am not blaming teamwork for having this kind of report, it looks good for granular analysis but I needed something a bit more visual.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>2) CSV to BigQuery<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">After viewing data within Teamwork for a while, we thought of getting data out and trying to visualize it manually. Teamwork has a handy CSV feature which was able to use to get data to google sheets and then build a few charts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Then we thought to hang on, Google just released this new and shiny Looker Studio with a sheets integration, let&#8217;s try that. And even though it was a manual weekly process the data proved very useful, so much so that we decided to use <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/bigquery\/what-is-bigquery\">BigQuery<\/a> to automate fetching data. We setup a pipeline using the <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.teamwork.com\/timetracking#retrieve_all_to-d\">Teamwork API<\/a> and a custom Heroku app to fetch and transform data into BigQuery.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So far so good but this still suffered from a few issues; we had a scheduler running every night so data was not as real time as we wanted, plus occasionally the underlying data would change (a user tracked time to incorrect project or edited some details) which would cause confusion.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>3) Looker Studio with Teamwork Connector in Real Time<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">When Looker Studio introduced data connectors to import data from third party sources, we again thought of saying goodbye to BigQuery and jump to Looker Studio. This had a few benefits, for one it allowed us to query data in realtime and see what everyone was working on even in the last couple of hours. To do so we had to create our own data connector using <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/apps-script\/\">AppScript<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">We can use it to import your teamwork time entries and create report. Even you can use our pre-built template. In case you also use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teamwork.com\/\">teamwork<\/a>, our data connector is now available in <a href=\"https:\/\/datastudio.google.com\/data?search=teamwork\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data connectors gallery<\/a> and FREE :).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/teamwork-connector.png\" alt=\" data studio connectors gallary \" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">You can follow the instructions <a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/connect-teamwork-connector-with-data-studio\">here<\/a> to use this connector.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>Also using teamwork use our template?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">We made this template very easy to read and provided filters to view each team member data in a separately.
