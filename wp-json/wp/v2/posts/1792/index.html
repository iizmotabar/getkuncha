It is being integrated into millions of websites worldwide. One of the most concerned questions related to this tool is whether it is capable of tracking individual users or not?<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for the answer to the above question, you would definitely need to understand how Google Analytics tracks website visitors.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The purpose of Google Analytics tracking code<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As we all know that we have to place the GA tracking code on our website to see traffic details in Analytics. Whenever a new visitor lands on your website, this tracking code places a line of code containing a unique id named as client_id in the visitor\u2019s browser.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever the same user visits your site again from the same browser this id is used to identify as a returning visitor. But if the user clears his browser cookies before visiting your site, he will be assigned a new client id and he will be identified as a new user.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with client id is that a visitor will only be identified as a unique visitor until he is using the similar browser\/device to visit your website. The time he switched to a new browser or device he will be assigned another client id.<\/p>\n<p>You can see the client id reports in analytics by navigating to <strong>Audience &gt;&gt; User Explorer.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/73_image-asset.png\" alt=\" user explorer reports \"><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Tracking Individual Users In Analytics &#8211; The Alternate<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To track every individual user in Google Analytics, you will have to implement User_ID.
