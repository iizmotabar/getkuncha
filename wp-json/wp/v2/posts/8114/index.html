It proved to be successful for most of the online businesses. During this year, we stepped into the world of content marketing and published some great content to build, educate and help our audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This is a review article about what we did in the last year and a good opportunity for you to learn from our experiences. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">We tried to work on several ideas and to be honest, we didn\u2019t succeed with all. Some of the ideas worked well, some didn\u2019t work for us. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The ideas that Inspired Us<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Behind the success of every online business, there is always an inspiration of a third party. So to get started with our content marketing process we started with <\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/priceonomics.com\/the-content-marketing-handbook\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">the content marketing handbook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. The story of priceonomics, how they built a business turning data into content. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The second idea was to compete by implementing technical seo. We got this idea after Hubspot published an article about how they <\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/technical-seo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">increased organic traffic by over 50% using technical seo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:16px\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Below is an overview of what content strategies we followed and what really worked for us. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Techniques that worked<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:18.6667px\">Optimized our website<\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">You would all agree with the fact that to get appeared on the web, your website <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">must be optimized for search engines. Before we started optimizing our website,&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">we first analyzed our site to see which areas needed to be optimized. Below is the list of things we thought quite necessary to work on the first step. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18.6667px\">Keyword research<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The first thing we noted, our site was not optimized for the right keywords.<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">There were some random keywords related to our industry which were quite difficult to rank. Thanks to some great online tools that helped us dig <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">some <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">specific keywords we could rank for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18.6667px\">Optimized old content\/on-site optimization<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">We already had some content published on our blog page which was generating enough organic traffic. To maintain and improve organic <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">ranking, we had to optimize older content. Adding keywords in the title and wherever it fits in the body, especially at the beginning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18.6667px\">Added &amp; optimized images<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Our old content had no header images, so we created some relevant <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">images using canva and reshared our old content on social sites.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">2.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:18.6667px\">Researched more topics to write about<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Previously, we were only focused on few targeted keywords and we published posts targeting those specific keywords. Ever since we determined our audience <span style=\"font-size:16px\">interests, we stretched out to target more keywords. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">After analyzing our audience we found that most of them are related to content marketing and digital marketing. So, we decided to cover that niche as well, which in return boosted our site traffic by 23%. Here are some great content we published related to content marketing. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/improve-content-marketing-using-google-analytics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boost your content marketing strategy using google analytics<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/measuring-content-marketing-kpis-in-google-analytics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Measuring content marketing KPIs via google analytics<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/blog\/measure-success-of-your-marketing-campaigns\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Measure marketing campaign effectiveness using google analytics <\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18.6667px\">3. Published articles consistently<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Since we created our business site we published articles randomly, often we <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">used to publish a single post in a year. Once we found the trick to rank on search <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">engines, we started to write more and publish content consistently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This helped us maintain our site with fresh and updated content and hence showing google bots a positive impression.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">4.&nbsp;<\/span>Expanded our social presence<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">The next challenging step for us was to expand our social presence and to be <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">known around the web. We started reaching out all online communities aiming to <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">help other members by answering their questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">This was fairly a good idea to recognize our self among huge audiences and<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">promote our content links. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>5.&nbsp;Started an faq page<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">After answering different types of questions on several social communities, we <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">created a separate faq page on our site. This page was created to answer the <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">most critical &amp; aching questions of community members. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Below are two popular posts from our faq page.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/using-inpage-analytics-chrome-extension\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to use inpage analytics chrome extension<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/analytics-faq\/move-a-property-in-google-analytics-to-another-account\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to move a property in google analytics<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6.&nbsp;Updated website technical SEO<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">The best way to beat your competitors is by improving your overall site SEO. We already <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">did much to improve site SEO, but here we added meta tags to our site to help google <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">bots better crawl and identify our content. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">7.&nbsp;<\/span>Focused on writing tutorials<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">One of our solid reason for writing content is to educate our audience. That\u2019s the reason we started writing how-to tutorials which include installing google analytics on different <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">CMS platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">8.&nbsp;<\/span>Published some infographics<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">So far, our content was just straight without any attraction and shareable content. To <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">improve one step further we followed the market trend and created a few infographics.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">The purpose was to get more social shares and in return get more traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The techniques that didn\u2019t work well<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:18.6667px\">Reached out people in the same niche<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">To get more social shares and improve website traffic, we approached people in the <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">same industry to review and share our content. To do this, we analyzed our twitter <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">followers and every time we published an article, we contacted 30 of our followers who <\/span><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">work in the same niche to give us feedback. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">We practiced this technique for almost 2 months but we didn\u2019t get any positive feedback. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">2.&nbsp;<\/span>Created pdf for long articles<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">One of our content marketing purposes was to be able to generate leads. To start <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">this process we created ebooks for tutorial type and technical articles. This was<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">our first step to getting visitor\u2019s information. We are still running this process and so far we haven\u2019t got any positive outcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">3.&nbsp;<\/span>Use <strong>Leadin<\/strong> to Capture Emails<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Up to this time, we also tried to use a tool to capture visitor email. To get the email <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">address, we tested the tool by allowing it to appear on different areas. Although <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">our website has enough daily visitors but this idea still seemed to be <\/span><span style=\"font-size:16px\">non-beneficial for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\">2016 was a year of new emerging ideas and inspirations for us. We experimented out new techniques, some of which were profitable and some of them a total failure, but as they say, \u2018\u2019try again and fail, but don\u2019t fail to try\u2019\u2019 so I guess this isn\u2019t the end! We are going to continue to dive deeper into this. Here is to seeing more of you all in 2017! \ud83d\ude42<\/span><\/p>\n<style>\n<p>\t.footer-section-cta {\n\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\tbackground: #263238;\n\t\tpadding: 20px;\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t.footer-seciton-title {\n\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\tcolor: #6fd350;\n\t\tfont-size: 35px;\n\t\tfont-family: Arial;\n      \tpadding-top: 20px;\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t.footer-section-items {\n\t\tdisplay: flex;\n\t\tjustify-content: space-around;\n\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\tmargin: 40px 0 50px;\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t.footer-section-item {\n\t\tpadding: 10px;\n\t\tborder: 1px solid;\n\t\tborder-radius: 5px;\n\t\twidth: 250px;\n\t\theight: 40px;\n\t\talign-items: center;\n\t\tdisplay: flex;\n\t\tflex-direction: column;\n\t\tjustify-content: center;\n\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\tcolor: #fff;\n\t\ttext-decoration: none;\n\t\tfont-weight: #e3e3e3;<\/p>\n<p>\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t.footer-contact-btn {<\/p>\n<p>\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t\t.footer-section-btn {\n\t\t\tpadding: 5px;\n\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\twidth: 300px;\t\n\t\t\theight: 30px;\n\t\t\tborder: 1px solid #6fd350;\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 5px;\n\t\t\tdisplay: flex;\n\t\t\tjustify-content: center;<\/p>\n<p>\t\t}<\/p>\n<p>\t\t.footer-section-btn a {\n\t\t\tpadding: 5px;\n\t\t\tcolor: #e3e3e3;\n\t\t\ttext-decoration: none;\n\t\t}<\/p>\n<\/style>\n<div class=\"footer-section-cta\">\n<div class=\"footer-seciton-title\">Are you Curious about MarketLytics?<\/div>\n<div class=\"footer-section-items\">\n\t\t<a class=\"footer-section-item\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/services\/\">ANALYTICS SERVICES<\/a><br \/>\n\t\t<a class=\"footer-section-item\" href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/work\/\">AWESOME CLIENTS<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"footer-contact-btn\">\n<div class=\"footer-section-btn\"><a href=\"https:\/\/marketlytics.com\/contact\/lets-talk\/\">HAVE A QUESTION?
